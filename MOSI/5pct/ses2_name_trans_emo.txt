Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_3,I wish it werent because I
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_4,Now I had some high expe maybe not high expectations per se but I was definitely expecting this to be a good movie
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_1,I just got back from the movie theaters to go see a movie Ive been waiting probably about a year and a half to two years for
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_15,They dont waste a lot of time on exposition because
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_12,the special effects were great and the guy who played Kato whose first name is Jay
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_29,Thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_2,I thought that the first one was creative and inventive and really brought something new to cinema
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_20,and I thought it worked worked pretty well
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_22,I think its because it was such a moving film
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_13,Uh hes just a jackass
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_10,something that just kind of makes them slightly endearing even though theyre kind of a jackass you know
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_18,they werent introduced well really
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_25,Its one to check out in theaters I would say
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_5,Its really just a heartwarming story
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_6,The only film Im really scared about is Small Soldiers
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_14,and the utter horrible and I mean absolutely atrocious Carla Giugino as Dr Vera Gorski whos
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_12,No No Hes unfunny Not funny at all
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_10,It gets straight into the story
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_10,I personally I liked Atlantis
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_11,and all the action scenes were great
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_29,This is Star Wars prequel territory
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_21,Hi Im pretty I have a giant smile Im supposed to know things Walk off screen
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_24,is perfect from start to finish
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_21,but seeing it today now where it was really nothing more than just a oneupspinship
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_15,boring
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_28,candy and just
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_24,The acting could be better and is very mediocre
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_25,So its a little awkward
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_5,it kind of controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a trans sequel
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_26,you could feel the seed jump in and then
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_1,ITS BAAAAAAD
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_11,He certainly doesnt fit the bill either for any Marvel movie Um Zero
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_12,I didnt really I mean Treasure Planet was okay
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_1,and it was actually pretty good
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_10,Its a joke really
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_13,who doesnt have any presence or greatness at all
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_18,all those action sequences involving the games were great to watch
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_13,And once Sam Flynn enters the grid the soundtrack draws you in
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_22,they ARE interesting characters
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_18,John Hamm and Scott Glenn could bring you know they could be interesting characters
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_15,Brad Bird is a great writer and director
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_25,Every time there was like a jumpy bit everyone jumped
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_5,and that describes cowboys and aliens pretty well
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_13,Same with Wades sword scene where hes like is that a cat
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_5,I hate it
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_28,And Clu has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever because what is Clu
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_10,The supporting cast is either hit or miss
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_2,But for someone like me who loves horror movies and
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_8,and they kind of looked like clowns The desert scene was one of them
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_19,you know its basically it was Stallone knowing these guys arent in shape they were 2025 years ago
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_14,Um Marvel once again decided to toss another random bitch in this movie
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_15,I couldnt even watch it
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_9,like it cracked on straight away with what the hells going on
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_11,Its gonna be really too long
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_25,But I thought that the best part of Saw V was the storyline like in general everything
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_3,All of you knew that obviously
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_23,and Hal Jordan flies off to the Green Lantern Corps planet of Oa and the movie starts sequelbaiting
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_1,Im still excited about it
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_27,and um yeah i think the only character who actually showed their motivations behind anything they did was the villain
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_12,you have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_19,Theres many different ways of saying sick nowadays
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_15,Um we had like we had guessed everybody um theres like this random character dude who what does he do
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_22,Although I do agree that the look could have been changed to fit the actual sabertooths like with the right hair
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_27,I expected a little bit more seriousness
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_1,Oh my gosh bad movie
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_13,They do a great job with their roles
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_31,There are parts of it that are very intense
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_21,And in fact in spite of all the negatives Im about to mention I thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third but at the end of Act 1 two significant things happen After Hammond arrives
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_18,Leave Shriever or however the fuck you say his name is a fucking tremendously awesome actor
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_5,it had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that other stuff
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_20,and I dont know if this scene took place 1520 years ago when these guys were in their absolute prime it would have been just an absolutely breathtaking monumental moment in cinematic history but
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_27,The acting ranges from mediocre to hamfisted from the live action actors
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_32,the movie was good
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_9,So the more women directors that I see I like seeing that
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_9,I still had fun with it
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_21,And then when I went to Blockbuster and I picked it up and I brought it back home he got really disappointed
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_22,good But if you dont expect a lot I think youll enjoy it
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_30,and uh its kind of interesting
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_27,You know a lot of people have been talking about the expendables even though it came out such a long time ago
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_16,just boring
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_29,and the actors do such a good job of carrying out their particular arcs
Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_10,And it is very rushed
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_10,because he was protecting over his family and after they went missing even though theyre a band of outsiders and they have all these powers
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_8,Its the best summer movie Ive seen all year
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_1,Find this mediocre in a roll
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_22,tripping in that
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_2,Really bad movie
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_1,and I was very impressed with his work on the first one
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_21,the storyline isnt
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_3,But um I liked it
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_31,There is people that want to go and see it havent seen it yet and they might see this video
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_20,The writing isnt as good as the first
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_24,So everyone like everyone at cinema was kind of like me because
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_9,really felt for the dad in the expendables
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_11,and the other one was completely irrelevant as far as I can tell
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_9,First Im going to get into the acting which was much much better than the second one
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_16,I dont know how to like tell you who he is without you being like that doesnt narrow it down at all
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_29,From there it does get a bit like not as real as what has been going on
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_12,Please resist from these two
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_5,Um I liked it I thought Catherine Hardwick did a good job
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_10,I love him as an actor based on his looks As an actual talented actor no
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_25,you actually feel for her character
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_20,But they you know they bring nothing to the table
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_3,but if you loved the series and you also liked and saw the first movie then youre still gonna have fun
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_13,Um I I dont like well I dont know if I want to say I dont like this but I wish that it would have been different who the wolf actually turned out to be
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_12,finally comes through on that
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_15,Ovarians bitch The random bitch that nobody knows where the fuck she came from Why Marvel Why do you sis are torturing me
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_2,If you are as big a fan of Disney as I am
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_33,Dont see it
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_27,It was not a huge saw twist moment
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_7,Not exactly what I was expecting
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_20,But then Sam Flynn meets his father and Tron basically turns into a Star Wars prequel after that one
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_25,and Ford is along for the ride and having a blast as the second lead
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_25,It doesnt make any sense because
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_16,Um the acting was pretty good
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_4,but quite frankly she is implausible
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_36,didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it open or anything its just open
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_21,the race stadium scene and the mall scenes in the beginning and the end where mass amounts of people die in the craziest ways are pretty good for late night buddy viewings you know what I mean by late night buddy
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_19,So it was just really really strange
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_1,And I was unbelievably shocked at how much I loved it
Ses02,73jzhE8R1TQ_6,So yeah and the movie was pretty good in my opinion
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_1,Most of the critics are right
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_4,I love when they show all the war scenes all the time they spent in the military and shit
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_21,the atmosphere like everyone just screams
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_7,Yep a horrible protagonist
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_6,anyway oh you can see Im still speechless this movie was just beautiful
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_17,Hes just like this this character whos kind of random and
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_6,So to me thats a pretty good movie
Ses02,73jzhE8R1TQ_4,It was a good thought
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_13,Um he was good
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_7,It was incredible To see all the different colored palettes smooth hand drawn animation You know
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_9,apology and Warner Brothers is never going to give you one
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_21,and which hurts the film drastically because
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_10,The first reason is the obvious just to make an exciting enjoyable action film
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_20,and
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_3,I mean it wasnt a bad year but
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_14,There are about two creative scenes in here one being an intestinal journey through the rectum in a swimming pool drain and a tire decapitation
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_14,The special effects look amazing
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_2,believe that a successful Green Lantern movie would lead Warner Bros to adapt The Flash and Wonder Woman among possibly others
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_8,Overall Browning just fails to deliver
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_21,in a movie called Cowboys and Aliens Daniel Craig steals the whole dang show
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_16,Kai made me feel depressed
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_3,little to no character development all movie
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_7,But I will say that the first third of this movie is amazing
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_24,and we kind of wanted it to be like that except not as obvious but that would have been good right Like because then it would give them a reason because they wanted to get married but they couldnt because she was going to marry the other guy
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_19,I thought it was really well put together
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_30,AND ITS LIKE YOURE A COMPUTER PROGRAM OKAY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD USING REAL PEOPLE ITS THE WORST WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT INFILTRATE SOME COMPUTER SYSTEM SOMEWHERE AND DETONATE SOME NUKES OR SOMETHING ,-2.0

Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_9,THIS MOVIE ESSENTIALLY WAS MADE FOR THREE REASONS IN MY OPINION,-0.25
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_20,AND THE SAME THING HAS MORE OR LESS HAPPENED HERE YEAH THATS RIGHT,-0.4
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_3,AND PUT THEM IN A JUSTICE LEAGE MOVIE WITH THE RITUAL BATMAN AND SUPERMAN,0.25
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_6,THOUGH I GUESS I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TURNED OUT AS GOOD AS IT DID,1.4
