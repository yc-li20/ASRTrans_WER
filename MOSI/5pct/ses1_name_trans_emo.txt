Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_20,But the two big character appearances in this movie are easily Deadpool and Gambit
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_13,Thats just me
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_12,But regardless I thought it was a very good movie
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_26,it picks up speed and never lets go even in even in the scenes like where they they slow down you know theyre meant to have some dialogue and and talk about whats going on you know
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_11,But for me I was just a little bored
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_4,that like to see comic book characters treated responsibly
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_25,But what would you do for a Green Lantern movie 2 that would be even worthwhile now
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_11,The thing is its a very good translation of the book
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_1,Im going to give the reasons why I like him
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_12,So Leo will have you creeped out to your inner core with a tiny little smile
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_12,But it all turns out great in the end
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_5,The visuals were great
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_7,and while the trailer made the film look real nice and cute
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_4,and I pretty much met my low expectations for the most part
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_18,There was enough in there for you to care about him
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_18,I mean it was like he was too lazy to take off the costume or something
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_1,what I would like to call Ryan Gosling leather shoe and suit porn
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_17,You know it was funny at times
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_27,and Michael Sheen as Arrow as well he was rather enjoyable to watch
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_3,which I think Rodriguez was going for he always said when he was going to do this sequel that he wanted this to be the predator equivalent of aliens
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_5,The only Oscar I could even think of is maybe like Best Cinematography
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_23,And there is a lot of it
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_19,And theres a vast difference between those two things
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_5,But theres a reason for that Theres a reason for why I was confused
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_19,I mean my stomach was almost going whoo as we went down the big drop
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_28,And I would want the sequences to be even longer rather than shorter
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_6,It doesnt hold back everything
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_8,lot of critics said that it relied too much on the audience to explore the themes in the film and you know rightly so I guess its
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_14,However it is this loyalty to the original source that gives it its flaws
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_5,Think that they personally thought Rachel Whitehurst really fucking love Suits and Ryan Gosling So they made this movie with me in mind like
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_7,from the way that its being released to the performances within it to the story itself is absolutely overthetop impressive
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_15,junior lady girl I mean she looked fantastic
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_15,It gave me chills
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_8,Uh and again if Id been paying closer attention I mightve followed it more
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_23,But hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life He stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_39,At first hes just kind of like a grumpy old guy but
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_8,I recommend this film to children 6 and up
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_5,But cinematically I thought it was quite good
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_24,they took a new spin on it and
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_21,If you look at it as a live action movie youre going to be disappointed
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_12,I didnt expect the action to be so intense
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_25,But what made this movie really fun was some of the adult humor jabs
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_15,and Keir Knightley I mean everybody knows her from Pirates of the Caribbean but
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_23,Its not like a period piece or anything
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_1,So I was kind of curious to see maybe if thats what Disney was going for and it definitely was what they were going for
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_7,and maybe best visual effects
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_10,But this movie about halfway through it I was checking the time and saw that this movie was two hours long
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_23,I didnt expect that
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_55,And sometimes it kind of veers into cliche action movie territory
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_22,But if you look at it as a cartoon which it pretty much mostly is with all the CGI effects
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_10,And you should all go out and see it and you know stuff
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_59,I really enjoyed cowboys and aliens
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_12,Nothin special
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_5,The movie also delivers many meaningful messages
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_15,I liked the girl who was the Israeli sniper
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_28,Daniel Craig does a very good job here
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_7,Um funny jokes that the kids will get
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_4,which I thought was awesome
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_11,Hes the star of the movie
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_18,New Moon even with a bigger better budget It was still too long
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_19,I guess the funny thing is despite everything bad about this movie I ended up halfway liking it
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_10,Kids are gonna love the film
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_21,dare I say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way and
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_21,The other ones unfortunately I think in the writing somewhere they just werent developed enough for you to care about them and that includes is it Topher Grace I think thats his name it includes his character
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_1,and I thought they were average
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_23,Now his scene in the beginning that really sold me
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_34,He doesnt take crap from anybody
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_13,Emma Stone was in this movie as well and you wouldnt really know it because she was hardly in it
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_4,I do not understand this movie
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_2,at the same time I do want to just say that I enjoyed this movie
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_4,But just going into this as an observer and someone who has no idea it was a fantastic film It was so much fun
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_16,Its a lot of fun
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_25,My favourite scene would definitely be the Volturi
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_13,Those three are some of the best young actors of today
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_17,It is definitely one of those films thats not going to be easy for you to find
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_45,and shes not a bad actress
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_13,And there was maybe one time where I thought I actually heard Russell Brandt himself
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_52,I was kind of expecting that
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_5,Because I three major complaints I have about this movie
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_48,There are some flaws here
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_3,I thought Twilight directed by Katherine Hardwick was actually really rather enjoyable
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_24,But then you kind of walk out of the movie and youre like well I get what happened and I understand what happened but
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_12,since the Smurfs are so adorable and they go on thrilling adventures
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_2,And just its very its very chaotic At the end of this movie I
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_23,Some of the moments in this you just the whole cinemas laughing
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_1,This movie is adorable
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_26,It was really cool when they did that
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_10,That was probably the part in the trailer that got me to go see the movie
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_17,and some people might think that theres a lot of cheap tricks but
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_21,It engages the audience more
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_1,But for this one I just didnt feel like it
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_27,and it does help alleviate what that whole worry is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_3,My reason I am a comic book fan
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_24,Its kind of upset about that
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_7,I would actually say that this is probably one of the first movies this year that Ive seen this year that youll want to see in 3D especially for just the opening portion
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_12,Its very much a lighthearted
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_3,I liked Gribble because he helped Milo get Milos mother away from the aliens
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_22,There was a lot of cheap child humor which
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_22,But anyways he was awesome
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_13,And its really funny
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_9,It might have been it might have made more sense
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_33,And
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_15,it looks like a cartoon
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_6,It was really really funny
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_26,I mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how are you supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or destroy him at the same time
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_21,And I was like kind of upset about it because
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_6,or why it was a mistake really to try and do that
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_26,The other guy that did a really good job was Jeffrey Dean Morgan
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_16,I felt like I was watching one of those Army of One commercials sometimes
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_14,I thought two hours was way too long for this movie
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_11,I wanted to see how they could frame that
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_2,Theres a lot of fun
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_7,But I did enjoy it
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_9,But again you cant expect a huge like cerebral mind bender from a movie called Cowboys  Aliens
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_12,So if you havent seen Winnie the Pooh and you like family films go see it
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_29,I didnt really feel the inclusion of his character was necessary
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_30,it could have been written out
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_4,I mean obviously it had its flaws
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_7,keen on hearing that Chris Weitz was going to direct Newman because of the destruction that was Philip Pullmans The Gold Compass
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_17,Like I kinda sound like I might have a penis
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_9,And in a way a lot of the themes in Never Let Me Go which were very profound and deep
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_9,fucking spoil anything for you just because like that would be rude
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_4,Its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for the summer time
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_9,Oh my gosh a lot of action
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_16,There is one scene in this movie that makes 3D entirely worth it
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_13,YOU KNOW WELL DRAWN OUT CHARACTER,1.4
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_17,UM I LIKED THE RUSSIAN GUY JURI ,1.0
