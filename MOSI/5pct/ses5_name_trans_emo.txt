Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_4,really did enjoy as well Wasnt too fond of the ending but
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_17,I mean the blood is like dry light with some scifi with some action and with likeable characters And that is important guys
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_21,and I am looking forward to see a sequel of this movie because
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_10,Sometimes I miss what was being said
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_2,Im sorry and disappointed to say this I didnt like it
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_10,Um and uh Friends with Benefits had its moment
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_9,I think theyre very good actors
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_16,I feel that the movie wasnt really concerned with being exciting
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_19,So you know its not like youre actually getting like Academy Award quality acting performances
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_30,because there really wasnt all that much to it for me
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_8,And now what I loved about this movie was like the supporting characters in this movie
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_3,Number one it means its much scarier than you could imagine
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_16,Like how can you go into a film into a leading role and have no idea who your character is
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_4,I will admit Im a vague Johnny Depp fan
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_10,I mean just the way its written is corneas
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_2,The Notebook is one of my favourite films
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_12,It also really didnt need a lot of the things that it had in it
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_11,Theres men in tights which is a hilarious spoof of the story
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_12,Like seriously
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_18,Um I would recommend it if you have little kids
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_3,And I was really hoping that this wont be just as good
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_3,so I really was not looking forward to seeing this movie
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_23,I really like this movie
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_27,Im David Christopher Appleson
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_29,He does a great job as Snake Eyes Its always cool to see that
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_6,And this is the thing Forensic benefits and no strings attached They are the same movie different ways of getting to the same point at the same point
Ses05,X3j2zQgwYgE_9,but lacks you know very lackluster
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_5,But I just wasnt I just I dont know I didnt really like the movie all that much
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_19,Still the church shootout however brief that was it was alright
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_32,a movie to go with friends alone with family to watch in a rainy day and if you can watch it at half price at a midnight show screening
Ses05,Vj1wYRQjB-o_8,They did a good job with the car
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_20,their eyes are kind of like this welcome to the Polar Express
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_13,The characters are all the same and
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_1,And I really really loved it
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_4,My eightyearold was terrified through part of this because the original version is terrifying
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_37,so the addition of his character is pretty pointless
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_14,It did seem to focus too much on epic epic epic
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_10,Maybe only five jokes made me laugh
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_2,there were times in the movie where I felt really bored
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_2,If you are looking for a movie that has anything realistic in it you should not be looking at this movie because it is insane
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_10,Its nothing major nothing
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_21,Oh it was just so cool
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_8,anyone who knows me knows that Lord of the Rings trilogy is probably my favorite movie ever
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_19,like were supposed to believe that these two are in their mid to you know mid 30s at the oldest and theyre looking pretty rough in this movie like
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_5,and its fun to watch
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_5,I was really disappointed in that
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_14,and this film is this amazing is a slavish devotion Charles Dickens with an amusement park ride
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_21,and it disappointed me highly and
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_53,very few and
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_11,I just personally I just didnt really enjoy it
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_21,that you really can kind of sympathize with I guess if you have kids
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_2,Punch Poop currently in theaters starring no one youve ever heard of
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_18,And she talks at her too
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_7,the soundtrack is good its really good some really great songs
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_7,the actings a little rough in some parts
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_26,youre hoping to if you have to have if you have kids and youre forced to go which you probably will if you have kids you know put up with it as a parent but
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_30,But that didnt really matter
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_22,and there actually was one scene that I found
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_17,And she looks like Renee Zellweger and Helen Hunt from the Twister movie
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_3,I really did
Ses05,ZAIRrfG22O0_1,keeper save your money wait till it comes out of rental
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_1,Id like to quickly talk about machete
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_1,but I do want to tell you about Priest
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_13,Because if Id seen it over the summer I probably would have rated it the best action movie I saw this summer
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_6,The action and humor were mostly flat
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_7,But on the other hand I was really weary of going like
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_32,It wasnt even remotely good
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_11,I really dig the special effects of this movie
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_5,But there were a lot of great movies out this year
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_1,Which would have been a better name for the movie
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_4,but its just such a waste of money for them like when i see a movie thats obviously had a very good budget and its like not even good it makes me angry because im just like why are you wasting so much money
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_14,and fun even as good as the first two movies
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_10,I didnt think it was sad
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_11,Therefore a lot of the social commentary goes whoop over your head
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_23,I think Rachel Nichols had a lot of fun with her role
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_43,But really I should have just walked up and left at that moment
Ses05,ZAIRrfG22O0_8,and youre better off saving your money and maybe renting it when it comes out on video
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_50,This should really be one
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_17,if I dont give Zack Snyder the benefit of the doubt
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_46,It could have been so much better
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_8,But but I just didnt didnt laugh
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_8,Jim Carrey Ewan McGregor I like the two of them
Ses05,Vj1wYRQjB-o_2,It also has a really cool gun Its like a Desert Eagle but it has two barrels to it
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_24,My lanes are a lot of fun
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_8,I didnt think it was funny
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_1,I really wanted to see it actually but
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_24,It was a waste of my time
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_13,it could have been shorter
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_3,but this movie kind of came off like somebodys really sad travel video I dont know
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_21,All the guys I went with were pretty much on my page They were just like wow that was stupid Wow
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_10,expression throughout the entire film It was like its like pouty
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_11,and Jim Carrey I kind of light went off I love I used to imitate his comedy style when I was younger believe it or not
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_9,I thought it was very funny
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_35,So if you like to hear a more positive review check out her review it is very good
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_6,If I think about it honestly the plot wasnt that great
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_11,A lot of those movies bring a cute laugh here and there
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_12,and quite honestly I wish Id seen this over the summer
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_8,But all in all I just thought it was really overly sad
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_15,I mean Johnny Depps a wonderful voice actor so hes an incredible voice actor
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_9,Another thing about this film and its devotion is that sometimes my children could not understand what was being said because they were speaking Dickinsonian English
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_27,in the film are very relatable
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_9,Anyways the music is good
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_14,Even when they are fighting in the movie though it just seems like its their banter not actual dislike
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_6,could barely stay awake through the movie
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_10,McGregor happens to be one of my favorites
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_32,um yeah I mean if you want to see a video um of somebody who enjoyed the film
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_2,And first of all I actually was never a huge fan of the GI Joe TV series
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_26,It was good for the entire family
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_26,Quay I think had a lot of fun
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_8,And the bad thing about that is that all those songs well not all of them but some of the songs are not well connected with the scenes
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_15,I really love the melodramatic overthetop crazy action sort of thing going on
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_16,But this is kind of
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_22,And thanks for listening to me ramble
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_7,offered nothing of the such it wasnt
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_16,Theres a scene in a cave where they fight a giant monster that really reminds me of some sort of Lord of the Rings Minds of Moria moment
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_17,most likely from going very quickly through London with you know demon horses chasing you So theres that
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_22,In particular Joseph Gordon Levin had a lot of fun with his role
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_9,It probably would have helped if I went with someone if at least one other person went with me
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_12,But I just couldnt find it funny
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_28,Yeah I mean it has some fun moments
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_18,The characters of I am number 4 are likeable
Ses05,X3j2zQgwYgE_10,Be forewarned though expectations
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_3,The countryside which they showed while going across Ireland was astoundingly beautiful
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_15,So if I give Zack Snyder the benefit of the doubt this is a movie that looks great has some bad acting
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_8,And its truly heartbreaking to see that contrasted with the state of things
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_2,I was not looking forward to see this movie
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_31,uh everything else held up its own
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_11,because its an audience pleaser you know
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_18,the most upbeat characters throughout the whole movie
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_4,And she also has pretty sweet moves
Ses05,ZAIRrfG22O0_2,For me it was a waste of time
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_7,Its a fun chick flick
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_25,and I dont suggest anyone go see it
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_6,Some really fun touches within the movie is that two vampires in other shows appear in this movie not as vampires
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_55,I definitely suggest
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_20,And now the performances are like something to write home about
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_13,If youre a lover of Jim Carrey a lover of Ewan McGregor then youll like this movie
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_21,Hes not gonna be looking like a chipper bright young man but early 30s really you want me to buy that
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_13,Nah I guess so I mean its its it wasnt annoying
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_8,I was not bored during no strings attached
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_4,Um but I gotta say maybe my expectations were lowered by these other reviews that I read but
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_12,Other notable mentions are Christopher Plummer plays
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_6,I mean it had some good moments
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_4,know its not meant to be taken seriously maybe 70s exploitation movies are more cheesy than machete
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_51,but Im going to give it two to be fair because
Ses05,X3j2zQgwYgE_2,I really think what this was missing was that humor and that wit that is in the other Shrek movies
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_35,But they didnt even give him that much to do He had only a few minor lines
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_29,Um the one thing I didnt like about this movie was they brought the main chara uh the bad character I should say in kinda late
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_11,or something I would recommend unless
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_17,be this really quirky little chameleon
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_14,And the ending was really really great too
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_39,but I still found it pointless in the end of the movie
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_22,I just sat with the guys and we all tried to stay awake through it and kept falling asleep and didnt talk about how stupid it was
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_23,especially when hes hanging out with the merry men who all but one of them are probably early 20s and one of them is maybe mid20s and meanwhile theyre hanging out with papa russell it just looks like you know a bunch of guys hanging out and someone brought their dad along because he offered to
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_19,BUT IF YOU DONT REALLY HAVE ANY SMALL FRIENDS UH THAT SOUNDED REALLY PERVERTED SMALL CHILDREN THAT YOU ARE RELATED TO UM TO TAKE TO THE MOVIES UH I WOULDNT GO SEE IT BY MYSELF,-1.4
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_27,CAUSE I HAD A GOOD TIME,1.33333333333
