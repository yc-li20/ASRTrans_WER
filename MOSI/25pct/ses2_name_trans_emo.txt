Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_11,N WOULD BE OREALLY TO LONG
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_25,BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE BEST PART OF SAW FIVE WAS THE STORY LINE LIKE IN GENERAL EVERYTHIN
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_3,ALL OF YOU KNEW THAT OBVIOUSLY
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_23,AND HAL JORDAN FLIES OFF TO THE GREENLANTERN CORS PLANET OF OA AND THE MOVIE STARTS SEQUEL BATING

Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_18,LEAVE SHRIBUR OHARVA TO FOKEST SAY HIS NAME IS A FOOKING TREMENDOUSLY AUSUME ACTOR A
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_5,IT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF POTENTIALLY SETTING UP ALL THAT OTHER STUFF
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_20,AND I DONT KNOW IF THIS SCENE TOOK PLACE FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN HES GUISES WHEN YOURE ABSOLUTE PRIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING MONUMENTAL MOMENT IN SCYMATIC HISTORY BUT
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_27,THE ACTING RANGES FROM MEDIOCRE TO HAM FISTED FROM THE LIVE ACTION ACTORS
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_32,THE MOVE HE WAS GOOD

Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_10,IT IS VERY RUSHED
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_10,BECAUSE HE WAS PROTECTING OVER HIS FAMILY AND AFTER THEY WENT MISSING EVEN THOUGH THEIR A BAND OF OUTSIDERS A THEY HAVE ALL THESE POWERS

Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_11,AND YOU DONT SEE WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_9,THIS MOVI ESSENTIALLY WAS MADE FOR THREE REASONS IN MY OPINION
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_20,AND THE SAME THING HAS MORE OR LESS HAPPENED HERE YA THATS RIGHT
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_3,AND PUT THEM IN A JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVI WITH A RA TOOL BATMAN AND SUPER MAN
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_6,THOUGH I GUESS I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TURNED OUT AS GOOD AS IT DID BECAUSE
Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_13,LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE CARCAT TE FOUNDMEN BUT NONE WHERE THESE TWO SHOULD BE TOGETHER DIR

Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_25,IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_6,IN FACT ID HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS ONE OF TOSE OB NOXIOUS MAIN CHARACTERS IAVE SEEN A LONG TIME
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_18,BUT I AM IT WAS JONT BE LA

Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_30,THE ACTION IN THE MOVE IS SO WELL USED
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_1,I CAN EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIN ADEQUATELY WITHOUT DESCRIBING SOME SPECIFIC THINGS IN THE THIRD ACT OF THE MOVIE WHICH
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_2,NOT A COMPELLING NARRATIVE BY ANY MEANS THEIR
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_1,COWBOYS AND ALIENS METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE ANAFEL TEAMS THAT HAS THE TALENT TO BE A SUPERBOL CHAMPION BUT INSTEAD ENDS UP BEING A WILD CARD TEAM THAT GETS DISMISSED IN THE FIRST RUNT OF THE PLAYOFFS
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_29,NDY  JUST OVER ALL SUPERB
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_18,AND THE ACTION WASNT THE MOST MEMORABLE THING ABOUT ANY OF THOSE MOVIES
