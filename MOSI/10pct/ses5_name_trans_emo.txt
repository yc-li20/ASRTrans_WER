Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_4,really did enjoy as well Wasnt too fond of the ending but
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_17,I mean the blood is like dry light with some scifi with some action and with likeable characters And that is important guys
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_21,and I am looking forward to see a sequel of this movie because
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_10,Sometimes I miss what was being said
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_2,Im sorry and disappointed to say this I didnt like it
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_10,Um and uh Friends with Benefits had its moment
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_9,I think theyre very good actors
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_16,I feel that the movie wasnt really concerned with being exciting
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_19,So you know its not like youre actually getting like Academy Award quality acting performances
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_30,because there really wasnt all that much to it for me
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_8,And now what I loved about this movie was like the supporting characters in this movie
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_3,Number one it means its much scarier than you could imagine
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_16,Like how can you go into a film into a leading role and have no idea who your character is
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_4,I will admit Im a vague Johnny Depp fan
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_10,I mean just the way its written is corneas
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_2,The Notebook is one of my favourite films
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_12,It also really didnt need a lot of the things that it had in it
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_11,Theres men in tights which is a hilarious spoof of the story
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_12,Like seriously
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_18,Um I would recommend it if you have little kids
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_3,And I was really hoping that this wont be just as good
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_3,so I really was not looking forward to seeing this movie
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_23,I really like this movie
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_27,Im David Christopher Appleson
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_29,He does a great job as Snake Eyes Its always cool to see that
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_6,And this is the thing Forensic benefits and no strings attached They are the same movie different ways of getting to the same point at the same point
Ses05,X3j2zQgwYgE_9,but lacks you know very lackluster
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_5,But I just wasnt I just I dont know I didnt really like the movie all that much
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_19,Still the church shootout however brief that was it was alright
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_32,a movie to go with friends alone with family to watch in a rainy day and if you can watch it at half price at a midnight show screening
Ses05,Vj1wYRQjB-o_8,They did a good job with the car
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_20,their eyes are kind of like this welcome to the Polar Express
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_13,The characters are all the same and
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_1,And I really really loved it
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_4,My eightyearold was terrified through part of this because the original version is terrifying
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_37,so the addition of his character is pretty pointless
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_14,It did seem to focus too much on epic epic epic
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_10,Maybe only five jokes made me laugh
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_2,there were times in the movie where I felt really bored
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_2,If you are looking for a movie that has anything realistic in it you should not be looking at this movie because it is insane
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_10,Its nothing major nothing
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_21,Oh it was just so cool
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_8,anyone who knows me knows that Lord of the Rings trilogy is probably my favorite movie ever
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_19,like were supposed to believe that these two are in their mid to you know mid 30s at the oldest and theyre looking pretty rough in this movie like
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_5,and its fun to watch
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_5,I was really disappointed in that
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_14,and this film is this amazing is a slavish devotion Charles Dickens with an amusement park ride
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_21,and it disappointed me highly and
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_53,very few and
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_11,I just personally I just didnt really enjoy it
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_21,that you really can kind of sympathize with I guess if you have kids
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_2,Punch Poop currently in theaters starring no one youve ever heard of
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_18,And she talks at her too
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_7,the soundtrack is good its really good some really great songs
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_7,the actings a little rough in some parts
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_26,youre hoping to if you have to have if you have kids and youre forced to go which you probably will if you have kids you know put up with it as a parent but
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_30,But that didnt really matter
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_22,and there actually was one scene that I found
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_17,And she looks like Renee Zellweger and Helen Hunt from the Twister movie
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_3,I really did
Ses05,ZAIRrfG22O0_1,keeper save your money wait till it comes out of rental
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_1,Id like to quickly talk about machete
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_1,but I do want to tell you about Priest
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_13,Because if Id seen it over the summer I probably would have rated it the best action movie I saw this summer
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_6,The action and humor were mostly flat
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_7,But on the other hand I was really weary of going like
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_32,It wasnt even remotely good
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_11,I really dig the special effects of this movie
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_5,But there were a lot of great movies out this year
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_1,Which would have been a better name for the movie
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_4,but its just such a waste of money for them like when i see a movie thats obviously had a very good budget and its like not even good it makes me angry because im just like why are you wasting so much money
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_14,and fun even as good as the first two movies
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_10,I didnt think it was sad
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_11,Therefore a lot of the social commentary goes whoop over your head
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_23,I think Rachel Nichols had a lot of fun with her role
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_43,But really I should have just walked up and left at that moment
Ses05,ZAIRrfG22O0_8,and youre better off saving your money and maybe renting it when it comes out on video
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_50,This should really be one
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_17,if I dont give Zack Snyder the benefit of the doubt
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_46,It could have been so much better
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_8,But but I just didnt didnt laugh
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_8,Jim Carrey Ewan McGregor I like the two of them
Ses05,Vj1wYRQjB-o_2,It also has a really cool gun Its like a Desert Eagle but it has two barrels to it
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_24,My lanes are a lot of fun
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_8,I didnt think it was funny
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_1,I really wanted to see it actually but
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_24,It was a waste of my time
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_13,it could have been shorter
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_3,but this movie kind of came off like somebodys really sad travel video I dont know
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_21,All the guys I went with were pretty much on my page They were just like wow that was stupid Wow
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_10,expression throughout the entire film It was like its like pouty
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_11,and Jim Carrey I kind of light went off I love I used to imitate his comedy style when I was younger believe it or not
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_9,I thought it was very funny
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_35,So if you like to hear a more positive review check out her review it is very good
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_6,If I think about it honestly the plot wasnt that great
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_11,A lot of those movies bring a cute laugh here and there
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_12,and quite honestly I wish Id seen this over the summer
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_8,But all in all I just thought it was really overly sad
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_15,I mean Johnny Depps a wonderful voice actor so hes an incredible voice actor
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_9,Another thing about this film and its devotion is that sometimes my children could not understand what was being said because they were speaking Dickinsonian English
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_27,in the film are very relatable
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_9,Anyways the music is good
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_14,Even when they are fighting in the movie though it just seems like its their banter not actual dislike
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_6,could barely stay awake through the movie
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_10,McGregor happens to be one of my favorites
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_32,um yeah I mean if you want to see a video um of somebody who enjoyed the film
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_2,And first of all I actually was never a huge fan of the GI Joe TV series
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_26,It was good for the entire family
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_26,Quay I think had a lot of fun
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_8,And the bad thing about that is that all those songs well not all of them but some of the songs are not well connected with the scenes
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_15,I really love the melodramatic overthetop crazy action sort of thing going on
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_16,But this is kind of
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_22,And thanks for listening to me ramble
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_7,offered nothing of the such it wasnt
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_16,Theres a scene in a cave where they fight a giant monster that really reminds me of some sort of Lord of the Rings Minds of Moria moment
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_17,most likely from going very quickly through London with you know demon horses chasing you So theres that
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_22,In particular Joseph Gordon Levin had a lot of fun with his role
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_9,It probably would have helped if I went with someone if at least one other person went with me
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_12,But I just couldnt find it funny
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_28,Yeah I mean it has some fun moments
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_18,The characters of I am number 4 are likeable
Ses05,X3j2zQgwYgE_10,Be forewarned though expectations
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_3,The countryside which they showed while going across Ireland was astoundingly beautiful
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_15,So if I give Zack Snyder the benefit of the doubt this is a movie that looks great has some bad acting
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_8,And its truly heartbreaking to see that contrasted with the state of things
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_2,I was not looking forward to see this movie
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_31,uh everything else held up its own
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_11,because its an audience pleaser you know
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_18,the most upbeat characters throughout the whole movie
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_4,And she also has pretty sweet moves
Ses05,ZAIRrfG22O0_2,For me it was a waste of time
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_7,Its a fun chick flick
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_25,and I dont suggest anyone go see it
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_6,Some really fun touches within the movie is that two vampires in other shows appear in this movie not as vampires
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_55,I definitely suggest
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_20,And now the performances are like something to write home about
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_13,If youre a lover of Jim Carrey a lover of Ewan McGregor then youll like this movie
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_21,Hes not gonna be looking like a chipper bright young man but early 30s really you want me to buy that
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_13,Nah I guess so I mean its its it wasnt annoying
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_8,I was not bored during no strings attached
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_4,Um but I gotta say maybe my expectations were lowered by these other reviews that I read but
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_12,Other notable mentions are Christopher Plummer plays
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_6,I mean it had some good moments
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_4,know its not meant to be taken seriously maybe 70s exploitation movies are more cheesy than machete
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_51,but Im going to give it two to be fair because
Ses05,X3j2zQgwYgE_2,I really think what this was missing was that humor and that wit that is in the other Shrek movies
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_35,But they didnt even give him that much to do He had only a few minor lines
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_29,Um the one thing I didnt like about this movie was they brought the main chara uh the bad character I should say in kinda late
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_11,or something I would recommend unless
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_17,be this really quirky little chameleon
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_14,And the ending was really really great too
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_39,but I still found it pointless in the end of the movie
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_22,I just sat with the guys and we all tried to stay awake through it and kept falling asleep and didnt talk about how stupid it was
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_23,especially when hes hanging out with the merry men who all but one of them are probably early 20s and one of them is maybe mid20s and meanwhile theyre hanging out with papa russell it just looks like you know a bunch of guys hanging out and someone brought their dad along because he offered to
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_19,But if you dont really have any small friends that sounded really perverted small children that you are related to to take to the movies I wouldnt go see it by myself
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_27,Because I had a good time
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_30,and just as they are with all the other sequels that are coming out and this one
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_12,Theres a Kevin Costner Prince of Thieves version which was supposed to be the dark and edgy version of its time But I mean that was what 13 years ago 14 years ago probably more than that
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_6,and want to talk about the good things about this movie
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_9,Um if like me or some other white person or Hispanic person or whatever did the same jokes it would not be funny
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_12,or anything original
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_22,Cant do it
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_3,and there were times that I thought it was funny
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_34,So yeah if you want to have fun this weekend go watch this movie
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_10,Its sort of like a contrived plot thats been used over and over again
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_1,of Robin Hood starring Russell Crowe First thing I gotta say right off the bat I was dreading going in to see this movie
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_8,you know uh corny
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_13,He is brilliant There is not a movie that I see him in that I dont end up crying because he is so fantastic and he just breaks your heart whenever he does you know a role that usually his roles do break your heart at some point So definitely did in this movie
Ses05,Vj1wYRQjB-o_9,They did a good job with the flight scenes
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_18,And this is a cheesy movie
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_10,It would be completely inappropriate in fact to be racist
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_15,I did like Transformers 2 even though a lot of people didnt like that
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_17,And theres a better On Top of the Train flight than the first Mission Impossible movie
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_11,although I like I like dark humor but
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_12,or just really doesnt make any difference to us today at all
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_28,Its not really that great Everyone
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_5,I didnt mind it
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_29,But all in all I wasnt really that big of a fan
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_2,And I liked the first movie I thought the first movie was really good
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_21,Um that being said you can tell that a lot of people were having fun with this
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_14,it was just there I wasnt I wasnt amused
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_2,and I really enjoyed it
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_20,She does have a lot of issues
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_5,I just dont think it was very good
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_14,Now please I love movies
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_6,I mean its Nicks sparks book it must be good
Ses05,Vj1wYRQjB-o_3,Its pretty pretty scary looking
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_26,I think that like a lot of the issues
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_24,The picture quality was really great
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_18,and there was nothing wed offer
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_1,Nightnight screening plus I am number four you cant go wrong with that
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_4,And there were times that I was just sitting there after they said their jokes and I was like thats not nobodys laughing thats not funny
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_1,Im going to start off by saying that I really wasnt very impressed with the movie
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_4,I mean that sounds really harsh
Ses05,X3j2zQgwYgE_8,And I guess normally Shrek is for adults
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_18,So yes I really enjoyed it
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_3,Um I liked a lot of the movie
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_24,Um but this movie it had everything humor romance action
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_4,And this town was like from a good old Western
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_22,but like thats kind of depressing
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_15,and it really just lacked what made the other movies more enjoyable
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_20,I can appreciate that
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_18,This one really cool action sequence is where like this Johnny Depps posse they were getting chased by all these like possums or
Ses05,ZAIRrfG22O0_9,But theres definitely far better movies that you can go see than Zookeeper
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_9,all the animals were just so funny
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_13,Oh it has some really good references of past Johnny Depp films in it like while the chameleons getting bounced along the highway you run into Hunter S Thompson
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_30,movie is how international
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_12,And he is one of my favorite actors ever
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_3,I couldnt get into it
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_16,and he wasnt even that great this time around
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_9,All the problems that come to stop them getting to their destination are although plausible a little weak
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_19,This is weird
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_7,It actually has some thematically it has some cool themes about heroism and about taking ownership of yourself and things like that which I resonated with and which I appreciated
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_16,But you know like this movie uh this really uh would have made up for the disappointment that I had in Terminator Salvation
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_18,So thank you very much Thank you very much
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_20,He looked awesome while he did it but yeah Okay so like all the girls who went all disagree with me They think it was an amazing movie but they all think it was amazing because they were staring at Daniel Craig the whole time and going oh my gosh hes so hot
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_19,killing these people you dont even know whats going on like dude get over yourself
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_17,The action feels that its um its pretty much just a quick cut or slash blood screen you know flat shi
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_25,course It was just it was fun It was a fun entertaining movie
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_11,like grumpy look and then maybe even when she was happy like she wouldnt frown her eyebrows thing but shed still be pouty and be like like that
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_29,but it was really good
Ses05,tmZoasNr4rU_15,a lot more than the expandables but
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_5,Um heres why yes theres problems with this and Im going to talk about them but you know it looks beautiful
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_16,And throughout the film youre going Gah Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Either from the terrifying characters or
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_1,was just fantastic surprising
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_15,Because this thing is meant to be seen in 3D
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_40,and the characters just werent the same as the first two that I fell in love with them
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_1,Um Ronin wanted to know what was the last movie we saw in theaters and to give a review for it
Ses05,Vj1wYRQjB-o_5,Like who would I mean its a
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_19,and simply it was dull for me
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_44,It was boring
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_28,I rate it 4 out of 5 stars
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_14,Hes super entertaining as the chameleon
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_38,I mean it plays into the story
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_6,I mean I went in there hoping to see something original and funny like the first two and
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_14,Okay shes staring Whats she thinking How does she feel I had no idea Like it was the same expression for shock or for sadness well what I presumed shed be sad but it really bugged me
Ses05,ZAIRrfG22O0_3,There were a few funny lines
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_28,So I think it was cool you got to see Ray Park in action great action star
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_11,I mean I didnt go into this movie expecting to see The Dark Knight
Ses05,Vj1wYRQjB-o_4,wouldnt want that pointed at me
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_33,I mean theres a few moments yeah that are original and funny
Ses05,WKA5OygbEKI_10,its not something that it would go by or
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_7,Just add a few funny parts
Ses05,wMbj6ajWbic_9,the script is corny
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_12,And both the actors Amy Adams and Matthew Goode work well with each other
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_45,and not at all original in my opinion
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_23,Um I enjoyed myself in it You might as well
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_31,But like I said if you like it feel free to go see it I just personally wasnt that into it
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_2,although Brock did a unique movie last Tuesday
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_20,The whole time I saw her all I saw was Colin Hunt and Renee Zellweger
Ses05,yvsjCA6Y5Fc_13,It just lacked the charm of those past movies
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_1,SUCK
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_10,is that that is that is a good thing
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_16,and I thought she was just like really natural and funny
Ses05,TvyZBvOMOTc_4,And in the scene of the destroyed castle it really reminded me why I wanted to go there so badly
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_10,even he was a douchebag all of them
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_3,Now I had no idea how good this movie was gonna be
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_11,Every single cowboy was just a complete douchebag
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_13,amazing special effects
Ses05,ZUXBRvtny7o_19,not like the character of Twilight
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_1,And this is the one that I can say I was definitely disappointed in
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_22,I actually like the film
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_4,And it just plain didnt have anything new to offer
Ses05,tStelxIAHjw_15,I kind of have an artistic video up on my main channel
Ses05,vvZ4IcEtiZc_6,Some of the great performances of last year were kind of overlooked because theres just so many of them
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_47,the second SQL was really great
Ses05,VCslbP0mgZI_14,But Zack Snyder is a guy And because of that this stuff kinda ends up looking like the HeMan Woman Haters Club
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_31,I have to agree on the negative side it was not great
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_13,but he wasnt even interesting
Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_15,as an actor I really think especially an actor in the leading role you really should prepare for that role
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_21,I laughed at quite a bit of the dialogue
Ses05,W8NXH0Djyww_11,Like the dumb kind of cowboys that dont know what theyre doing always asking dumb questions staying saying stupid shit
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_36,and none of them were really that great or anything stands out in your mind
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_11,Which basically means hes Wormtongue again in a different way
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_22,I was just so discouraged after seeing that movie and I know
Ses05,VbQk4H8hgr0_11,really that funny
Ses05,yDtzw_Y-7RU_6,Because this is a film that basically says you know what you should do You should take care of poor people because Jesus told us to take care of poor people And if you dont take care of poor people youre going to burn in hell
Ses05,zhpQhgha_KU_22,I mean even if you dont have kids because

Ses05,tIrG4oNLFzE_13,Like theres loads of moments in the film especially in the beginning where shed sit there stand there with her arms crossed and just look out into the distance like just with this same expression or shed look across the beach or shed look at her dad or shed look at her brother with the same expression And I was just like what are you thinking I dont understand what this characters doing
Ses05,X3j2zQgwYgE_3,Um its just not fair
Ses05,v0zCBqDeKcE_15,I love all aspects of movies

Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_8,All the characters were just so unl
Ses05,vyB00TXsimI_10,Yeah thats about how my favorites list goes
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_9,unlikable just there was only one character the doctor He was the only person I even really cared about
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_21,Another thing is like the fact that there was not one healthy relationship or positive good relationship in this whole movie
Ses05,Sqr0AcuoNnk_15,The lady who plays Justin Timberlakes sister I thought she was very good in this movie
Ses05,rnaNMUZpvvg_17,Why are you killing everyone
