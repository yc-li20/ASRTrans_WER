Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_3,I wish it werent because I
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_4,Now I had some high expe maybe not high expectations per se but I was definitely expecting this to be a good movie
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_1,I just got back from the movie theaters to go see a movie Ive been waiting probably about a year and a half to two years for
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_15,They dont waste a lot of time on exposition because
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_12,the special effects were great and the guy who played Kato whose first name is Jay
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_29,Thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_2,I thought that the first one was creative and inventive and really brought something new to cinema
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_20,and I thought it worked worked pretty well
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_22,I think its because it was such a moving film
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_13,Uh hes just a jackass
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_10,something that just kind of makes them slightly endearing even though theyre kind of a jackass you know
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_18,they werent introduced well really
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_25,Its one to check out in theaters I would say
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_5,Its really just a heartwarming story
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_6,The only film Im really scared about is Small Soldiers
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_14,and the utter horrible and I mean absolutely atrocious Carla Giugino as Dr Vera Gorski whos
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_12,No No Hes unfunny Not funny at all
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_10,It gets straight into the story
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_10,I personally I liked Atlantis
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_11,and all the action scenes were great
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_29,This is Star Wars prequel territory
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_21,Hi Im pretty I have a giant smile Im supposed to know things Walk off screen
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_24,is perfect from start to finish
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_21,but seeing it today now where it was really nothing more than just a oneupspinship
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_15,boring
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_28,candy and just
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_24,The acting could be better and is very mediocre
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_25,So its a little awkward
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_5,it kind of controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a trans sequel
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_26,you could feel the seed jump in and then
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_1,ITS BAAAAAAD
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_11,He certainly doesnt fit the bill either for any Marvel movie Um Zero
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_12,I didnt really I mean Treasure Planet was okay
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_1,and it was actually pretty good
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_10,Its a joke really
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_13,who doesnt have any presence or greatness at all
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_18,all those action sequences involving the games were great to watch
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_13,And once Sam Flynn enters the grid the soundtrack draws you in
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_22,they ARE interesting characters
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_18,John Hamm and Scott Glenn could bring you know they could be interesting characters
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_15,Brad Bird is a great writer and director
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_25,Every time there was like a jumpy bit everyone jumped
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_5,and that describes cowboys and aliens pretty well
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_13,Same with Wades sword scene where hes like is that a cat
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_5,I hate it
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_28,And Clu has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever because what is Clu
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_10,The supporting cast is either hit or miss
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_2,But for someone like me who loves horror movies and
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_8,and they kind of looked like clowns The desert scene was one of them
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_19,you know its basically it was Stallone knowing these guys arent in shape they were 2025 years ago
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_14,Um Marvel once again decided to toss another random bitch in this movie
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_15,I couldnt even watch it
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_9,like it cracked on straight away with what the hells going on
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_11,Its gonna be really too long
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_25,But I thought that the best part of Saw V was the storyline like in general everything
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_3,All of you knew that obviously
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_23,and Hal Jordan flies off to the Green Lantern Corps planet of Oa and the movie starts sequelbaiting
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_1,Im still excited about it
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_27,and um yeah i think the only character who actually showed their motivations behind anything they did was the villain
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_12,you have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_19,Theres many different ways of saying sick nowadays
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_15,Um we had like we had guessed everybody um theres like this random character dude who what does he do
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_22,Although I do agree that the look could have been changed to fit the actual sabertooths like with the right hair
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_27,I expected a little bit more seriousness
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_1,Oh my gosh bad movie
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_13,They do a great job with their roles
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_31,There are parts of it that are very intense
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_21,And in fact in spite of all the negatives Im about to mention I thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third but at the end of Act 1 two significant things happen After Hammond arrives
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_18,Leave Shriever or however the fuck you say his name is a fucking tremendously awesome actor
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_5,it had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that other stuff
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_20,and I dont know if this scene took place 1520 years ago when these guys were in their absolute prime it would have been just an absolutely breathtaking monumental moment in cinematic history but
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_27,The acting ranges from mediocre to hamfisted from the live action actors
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_32,the movie was good
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_9,So the more women directors that I see I like seeing that
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_9,I still had fun with it
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_21,And then when I went to Blockbuster and I picked it up and I brought it back home he got really disappointed
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_22,good But if you dont expect a lot I think youll enjoy it
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_30,and uh its kind of interesting
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_27,You know a lot of people have been talking about the expendables even though it came out such a long time ago
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_16,just boring
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_29,and the actors do such a good job of carrying out their particular arcs
Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_10,And it is very rushed
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_10,because he was protecting over his family and after they went missing even though theyre a band of outsiders and they have all these powers
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_8,Its the best summer movie Ive seen all year
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_1,Find this mediocre in a roll
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_22,tripping in that
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_2,Really bad movie
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_1,and I was very impressed with his work on the first one
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_21,the storyline isnt
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_3,But um I liked it
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_31,There is people that want to go and see it havent seen it yet and they might see this video
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_20,The writing isnt as good as the first
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_24,So everyone like everyone at cinema was kind of like me because
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_9,really felt for the dad in the expendables
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_11,and the other one was completely irrelevant as far as I can tell
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_9,First Im going to get into the acting which was much much better than the second one
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_16,I dont know how to like tell you who he is without you being like that doesnt narrow it down at all
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_29,From there it does get a bit like not as real as what has been going on
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_12,Please resist from these two
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_5,Um I liked it I thought Catherine Hardwick did a good job
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_10,I love him as an actor based on his looks As an actual talented actor no
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_25,you actually feel for her character
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_20,But they you know they bring nothing to the table
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_3,but if you loved the series and you also liked and saw the first movie then youre still gonna have fun
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_13,Um I I dont like well I dont know if I want to say I dont like this but I wish that it would have been different who the wolf actually turned out to be
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_12,finally comes through on that
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_15,Ovarians bitch The random bitch that nobody knows where the fuck she came from Why Marvel Why do you sis are torturing me
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_2,If you are as big a fan of Disney as I am
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_33,Dont see it
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_27,It was not a huge saw twist moment
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_7,Not exactly what I was expecting
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_20,But then Sam Flynn meets his father and Tron basically turns into a Star Wars prequel after that one
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_25,and Ford is along for the ride and having a blast as the second lead
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_25,It doesnt make any sense because
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_16,Um the acting was pretty good
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_4,but quite frankly she is implausible
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_36,didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it open or anything its just open
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_21,the race stadium scene and the mall scenes in the beginning and the end where mass amounts of people die in the craziest ways are pretty good for late night buddy viewings you know what I mean by late night buddy
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_19,So it was just really really strange
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_1,And I was unbelievably shocked at how much I loved it
Ses02,73jzhE8R1TQ_6,So yeah and the movie was pretty good in my opinion
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_1,Most of the critics are right
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_4,I love when they show all the war scenes all the time they spent in the military and shit
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_21,the atmosphere like everyone just screams
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_7,Yep a horrible protagonist
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_6,anyway oh you can see Im still speechless this movie was just beautiful
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_17,Hes just like this this character whos kind of random and
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_6,So to me thats a pretty good movie
Ses02,73jzhE8R1TQ_4,It was a good thought
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_13,Um he was good
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_7,It was incredible To see all the different colored palettes smooth hand drawn animation You know
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_9,apology and Warner Brothers is never going to give you one
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_21,and which hurts the film drastically because
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_10,The first reason is the obvious just to make an exciting enjoyable action film
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_20,and
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_3,I mean it wasnt a bad year but
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_14,There are about two creative scenes in here one being an intestinal journey through the rectum in a swimming pool drain and a tire decapitation
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_14,The special effects look amazing
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_2,believe that a successful Green Lantern movie would lead Warner Bros to adapt The Flash and Wonder Woman among possibly others
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_8,Overall Browning just fails to deliver
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_21,in a movie called Cowboys and Aliens Daniel Craig steals the whole dang show
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_16,Kai made me feel depressed
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_3,little to no character development all movie
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_7,But I will say that the first third of this movie is amazing
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_24,and we kind of wanted it to be like that except not as obvious but that would have been good right Like because then it would give them a reason because they wanted to get married but they couldnt because she was going to marry the other guy
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_19,I thought it was really well put together
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_30,And its like dude youre a computer program OK If you want to take over the world using real people its the worst way you could possibly do that Infiltrate some computer system somewhere and detonate some
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_12,Um Id say go see it because I I enjoyed it Now um
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_4,Just go in with low expectations
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_21,disconnection that happens at that point because
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_26,You know shes going through this stress and you feel sorry for her and you want to help her
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_8,insidious and start really good
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_19,Take a bunch of your friends because you guys will have a good time
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_17,But it really surprised us I was sitting there going What You want to go home
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_2,It was full of action
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_3,He wasnt The same old goofy Seth Rogen that we all know
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_1,because Im a big fan of the first Tron
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_13,its just sometimes its just a bit like oh god you really should have done that cringe
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_2,And um Ill just say like overall if I think it was good
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_11,with you Before I get to the negatives of the movie let me list off a few of the positives
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_21,And it totally made up for that so thats okay
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_34,It pretty much just left the door wide open for Saw 6 which obviously
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_20,but in this oh my god I love you
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_16,And it was ridiculous
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_39,So congratulations to the writers for that
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_31,to pretty intense at the end
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_30,Cowboys and Aliens problem is the screenplay
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_40,but Ill smack him in the face for the other irrelevant plotline
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_4,But I dont exactly get scared
Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_5,But they did not execute it very well and
Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_11,I mean you dont see why these two people love each other
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_9,This movie essentially was made for three reasons in my opinion
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_20,the same thing has more or less happened here Yeah thats right
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_3,and put them in a Justice League movie with a retooled Batman and Superman
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_6,Though I guess I should be grateful that it turned out as good as it did because
Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_13,They have their own separate character development but none where these two should be together
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_22,We wanted it to be that she knew Amanda Seyfrieds character knew it was Peter but was pretending she didnt so that she had a reason to run away with him and they could be together
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_26,when the oak flint finds these things whatever they are they are so wise and naive kind of like knobby now that I think about it
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_10,Like it doesnt just like and I was saying oh that is the problem theres a storyline Its like straight away bang storyline started
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_24,FredDukes is the blog
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_5,and excited to see it
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_26,The ending was not you know crazy shocking or anything like usual
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_18,Um I would definitely recommend you go see it in theaters
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_20,and I would go to the cinema again to see it because
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_6,Not good
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_8,theres a bad guy gotta go take him out Thats really all that you need
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_29,I didnt like Peter
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_1,probably widely considered to be one of the most failed movies of the XMen franchise
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_9,But you know the premise is okay
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_26,and the cast is pretty well rounded out with supporting performances from guys like Sam Rockwell as The Doc
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_16,perfect for that role
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_22,It lost a lot of the feeling
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_6,Not a complicated story but
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_23,What I do if I jump I laugh
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_18,he I dont I think he maybe he got mad when I dont know
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_17,It was so cute
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_23,could have interesting backstories
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_22,um yeah the characters didnt care whether they lived or died
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_3,Because at the beginning of the 1980s people thought that computers could do anything
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_37,But like I said the plot of Hoffman and everything that was really really awesome
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_12,after he busts all his caps in the air and lands and all the dead bodies fall around him fucking sick
Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_6,They left a lot of plop holes
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_10,When I saw the first trailer back in November of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of mustsee movies for 2011
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_26,But first the visual effects here are stellar
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_20,But um yeah Well eh Saying that two scenes deaf scenes in here are unique is a bit harsh
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_27,and everyone was laughing afterwards
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_8,I say that for two reasons First because someone owes you an apology
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_4,But it was still a good film
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_31,Still its that kind of moviemaking
Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_9,You dont feel that these two people love each other
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_9,but I do not take Ryan Reynolds seriously for a shit in this movie
Ses02,BioHAh1qJAQ_19,the choreography the fights the special effects I was so happy to be back in the grid that I wasnt really thinking about the story or where the story was going
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_24,But yeah go check it out
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_10,So I thought you did great with this movie
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_7,To all the Green Lantern fans out there I am so sorry
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_5,So I think Im like immune to them
Ses02,cM3Yna7AavY_3,You know of course I was waiting for the princess and the frog
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_4,Because I truly love an action comedy flick even better right
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_24,and he was still boring
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_7,Its pretty fake
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_17,but his action isnt particularly memorable
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_8,But it was still really really really good and
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_8,But I like seeing female directors because there arent that many compared to guy directors
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_11,Some of the acting is a little bit like oh my god you wouldnt really do that
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_5,Really theres no humongous tale to these guys
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_20,And then Cameron Diaz whos supposed to be plucky I guess Shes kind of useless
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_25,it was painful to watch
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_6,In fact Id have to say that this was one of the most obnoxious main characters Ive seen in a long time
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_18,But erm it was jumpy like
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_11,The final product ultimately doesnt live up to the hype or to that first trailer but
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_26,that weve overcome that
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_30,its kind of like quite fake like its just I couldnt believe it I was like what what are you doing
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_4,there was a lot of potential left on the table
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_34,I know you guys are gonna love it
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_10,The second one had wooden acting in some places Im sorry
Ses02,c5xsKMxpXnc_7,Now this movie is terrible for these reasons
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_2,Now some of you might not know this but I was extremely excited about Saw V Okay Ill
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_15,I also love the casting of Mark Strong as Sinestro
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_16,she wanted to go home and thats like saying a lot for her because she likes horror movies as much as I do
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_22,It is funny Its a funny movie
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_6,And a few times I didnt like the fashion
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_22,and starts chewing scenery like its a 2 steak
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_7,Its not that violent
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_27,They are unique incredible
Ses02,cW1FSBF59ik_3,Im pretty sure the first time it happened you would have been kind of freaked out the whole time you know
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_9,And unlike other films where theyre kind of a narcissistic frat boy but they bring something to the table you know
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_30,and the action in the movie is so well used
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_1,I cant express my thoughts and feelings about this movie adequately without describing some specific things in the third act of the movie which is the third act of the movie which is the third act of the movie
Ses02,bvLlb-M3UXU_2,Its not a compelling narrative by any means
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_1,Cowboys and Aliens metaphorically speaking is like one of those NFL teams that has the talent to be a Super Bowl champion but instead ends up being a wildcard team that gets dismissed in the first round of the playoffs
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_29,and just overall superb
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_18,and the action wasnt the most memorable thing about any of those movies
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_41,I dont know what the hell they were thinking
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_5,with the average horror film The Uninvited and
Ses02,BvYR0L6f2Ig_5,so it was just about equal to the first one
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_15,accent is so awful
Ses02,BI97DNYfe5I_30,fun at the end
Ses02,Af8D0E4ZXaw_12,I love Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan as the voice actors
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_4,I thought it could be really bad um but it didnt look like it would be but it could have been
Ses02,BXuRRbG0Ugk_22,Hes playing a variation of the iconic manwithnoname character that was made famous by Clint Eastwood
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_19,really recommend you all see the expendables
Ses02,Ci-AH39fi3Y_31,is still good because
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_14,And I also thought the desert riding the camels all dropped up looking like clowns
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_19,um but yeah whatever uh he we thought it would be him because they werent showing him a lot but they showed him enough to they kind of be like oh it was him the end
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_27,I was saying if shes not gonna marry him I will
Ses02,c7UH_rxdZv4_28,He was the only character that was slightly interesting
Ses02,Clx4VXItLTE_22,And its just its so funny
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_1,Ive been waiting to see Red Riding Hood for a really long time and
Ses02,atnd_PF-Lbs_3,Im not even gonna go to the Lowes to make a whole nineminute video about this movie
Ses02,73jzhE8R1TQ_19,um another thing that did bother me were the kiss scenes um
Ses02,aiEXnCPZubE_25,There is some sort of greatness to Sucker Punch though
Ses02,bOL9jKpeJRs_20,My boyfriend got really excited when I told him we were going to go see the expen
Ses02,73jzhE8R1TQ_10,the numbers they and they kind of stuck to the book of it so so I like that and
Ses02,Bfr499ggo-0_15,but also not necessary
Ses02,73jzhE8R1TQ_11,But parts of it were too Hollywood for me
Ses02,cXypl4FnoZo_7,And she was kind of weird during Twilight
