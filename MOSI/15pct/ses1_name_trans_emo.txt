Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_20,But the two big character appearances in this movie are easily Deadpool and Gambit
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_13,Thats just me
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_12,But regardless I thought it was a very good movie
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_26,it picks up speed and never lets go even in even in the scenes like where they they slow down you know theyre meant to have some dialogue and and talk about whats going on you know
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_11,But for me I was just a little bored
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_4,that like to see comic book characters treated responsibly
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_25,But what would you do for a Green Lantern movie 2 that would be even worthwhile now
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_11,The thing is its a very good translation of the book
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_1,Im going to give the reasons why I like him
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_12,So Leo will have you creeped out to your inner core with a tiny little smile
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_12,But it all turns out great in the end
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_5,The visuals were great
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_7,and while the trailer made the film look real nice and cute
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_4,and I pretty much met my low expectations for the most part
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_18,There was enough in there for you to care about him
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_18,I mean it was like he was too lazy to take off the costume or something
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_1,what I would like to call Ryan Gosling leather shoe and suit porn
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_17,You know it was funny at times
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_27,and Michael Sheen as Arrow as well he was rather enjoyable to watch
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_3,which I think Rodriguez was going for he always said when he was going to do this sequel that he wanted this to be the predator equivalent of aliens
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_5,The only Oscar I could even think of is maybe like Best Cinematography
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_23,And there is a lot of it
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_19,And theres a vast difference between those two things
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_5,But theres a reason for that Theres a reason for why I was confused
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_19,I mean my stomach was almost going whoo as we went down the big drop
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_28,And I would want the sequences to be even longer rather than shorter
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_6,It doesnt hold back everything
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_8,lot of critics said that it relied too much on the audience to explore the themes in the film and you know rightly so I guess its
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_14,However it is this loyalty to the original source that gives it its flaws
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_5,Think that they personally thought Rachel Whitehurst really fucking love Suits and Ryan Gosling So they made this movie with me in mind like
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_7,from the way that its being released to the performances within it to the story itself is absolutely overthetop impressive
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_15,junior lady girl I mean she looked fantastic
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_15,It gave me chills
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_8,Uh and again if Id been paying closer attention I mightve followed it more
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_23,But hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life He stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_39,At first hes just kind of like a grumpy old guy but
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_8,I recommend this film to children 6 and up
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_5,But cinematically I thought it was quite good
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_24,they took a new spin on it and
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_21,If you look at it as a live action movie youre going to be disappointed
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_12,I didnt expect the action to be so intense
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_25,But what made this movie really fun was some of the adult humor jabs
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_15,and Keir Knightley I mean everybody knows her from Pirates of the Caribbean but
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_23,Its not like a period piece or anything
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_1,So I was kind of curious to see maybe if thats what Disney was going for and it definitely was what they were going for
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_7,and maybe best visual effects
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_10,But this movie about halfway through it I was checking the time and saw that this movie was two hours long
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_23,I didnt expect that
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_55,And sometimes it kind of veers into cliche action movie territory
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_22,But if you look at it as a cartoon which it pretty much mostly is with all the CGI effects
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_10,And you should all go out and see it and you know stuff
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_59,I really enjoyed cowboys and aliens
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_12,Nothin special
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_5,The movie also delivers many meaningful messages
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_15,I liked the girl who was the Israeli sniper
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_28,Daniel Craig does a very good job here
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_7,Um funny jokes that the kids will get
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_4,which I thought was awesome
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_11,Hes the star of the movie
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_18,New Moon even with a bigger better budget It was still too long
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_19,I guess the funny thing is despite everything bad about this movie I ended up halfway liking it
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_10,Kids are gonna love the film
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_21,dare I say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way and
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_21,The other ones unfortunately I think in the writing somewhere they just werent developed enough for you to care about them and that includes is it Topher Grace I think thats his name it includes his character
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_1,and I thought they were average
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_23,Now his scene in the beginning that really sold me
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_34,He doesnt take crap from anybody
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_13,Emma Stone was in this movie as well and you wouldnt really know it because she was hardly in it
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_4,I do not understand this movie
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_2,at the same time I do want to just say that I enjoyed this movie
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_4,But just going into this as an observer and someone who has no idea it was a fantastic film It was so much fun
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_16,Its a lot of fun
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_25,My favourite scene would definitely be the Volturi
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_13,Those three are some of the best young actors of today
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_17,It is definitely one of those films thats not going to be easy for you to find
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_45,and shes not a bad actress
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_13,And there was maybe one time where I thought I actually heard Russell Brandt himself
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_52,I was kind of expecting that
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_5,Because I three major complaints I have about this movie
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_48,There are some flaws here
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_3,I thought Twilight directed by Katherine Hardwick was actually really rather enjoyable
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_24,But then you kind of walk out of the movie and youre like well I get what happened and I understand what happened but
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_12,since the Smurfs are so adorable and they go on thrilling adventures
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_2,And just its very its very chaotic At the end of this movie I
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_23,Some of the moments in this you just the whole cinemas laughing
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_1,This movie is adorable
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_26,It was really cool when they did that
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_10,That was probably the part in the trailer that got me to go see the movie
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_17,and some people might think that theres a lot of cheap tricks but
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_21,It engages the audience more
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_1,But for this one I just didnt feel like it
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_27,and it does help alleviate what that whole worry is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_3,My reason I am a comic book fan
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_24,Its kind of upset about that
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_7,I would actually say that this is probably one of the first movies this year that Ive seen this year that youll want to see in 3D especially for just the opening portion
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_12,Its very much a lighthearted
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_3,I liked Gribble because he helped Milo get Milos mother away from the aliens
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_22,There was a lot of cheap child humor which
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_22,But anyways he was awesome
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_13,And its really funny
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_9,It might have been it might have made more sense
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_33,And
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_15,it looks like a cartoon
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_6,It was really really funny
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_26,I mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how are you supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or destroy him at the same time
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_21,And I was like kind of upset about it because
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_6,or why it was a mistake really to try and do that
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_26,The other guy that did a really good job was Jeffrey Dean Morgan
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_16,I felt like I was watching one of those Army of One commercials sometimes
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_14,I thought two hours was way too long for this movie
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_11,I wanted to see how they could frame that
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_2,Theres a lot of fun
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_7,But I did enjoy it
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_9,But again you cant expect a huge like cerebral mind bender from a movie called Cowboys  Aliens
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_12,So if you havent seen Winnie the Pooh and you like family films go see it
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_29,I didnt really feel the inclusion of his character was necessary
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_30,it could have been written out
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_4,I mean obviously it had its flaws
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_7,keen on hearing that Chris Weitz was going to direct Newman because of the destruction that was Philip Pullmans The Gold Compass
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_17,Like I kinda sound like I might have a penis
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_9,And in a way a lot of the themes in Never Let Me Go which were very profound and deep
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_9,fucking spoil anything for you just because like that would be rude
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_4,Its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for the summer time
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_9,Oh my gosh a lot of action
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_16,There is one scene in this movie that makes 3D entirely worth it
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_13,you know well drawn out character
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_17,I like the Russian guy Yuri I think
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_6,This was probably the best 3D movie Ive seen in a long time because it actually used 3D Toy Story
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_20,Ill tell you who made the movie
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_24,Absolutely not to be missed
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_15,horror film in the true sense that
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_8,It looks really good
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_27,the aliens were really cool looking
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_31,I knew that inception that they were gonna be dreaming
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_57,but sometimes it just veers into like cliche action movie territory agian
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_28,they meet up with Laurence Fishburnes character it does slow down a great deal
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_29,Im looking forward to it I gotta say
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_3,There were some really good things about this movie
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_8,I thought that film was awful
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_2,Now Im not even going to sugarcoat this this movie frustrated me to such an extreme extent that I was loudly exclaiming WHY at the end of the film
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_3,So I didnt have very high expectations for this movie
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_14,someone you cared about
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_33,Its very very interesting
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_13,But otherwise I dont know
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_53,I wasnt a huge fan of it
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_9,It is a fun family film
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_37,Harrison Fords also good
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_21,who was just kickass 100 of the time was the guy that played Rorschach
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_3,literally said out loud what Gay What is this movie that I am seeing What is this
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_2,but Im also going to give the reasons of why I dont think its going to be a classic in the same vein as the first movie Predator or Aliens
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_11,Thats a lot of sad parts
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_41,He gets developed more as a more likable character
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_22,I just really enjoyed it
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_24,actually found when hes seen come up it slowed the movie down and this is the problem with predator to predators compared to predator
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_14,And now Im not excited anymore
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_18,So look out for that That should be interesting
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_32,really badass
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_6,I also thought some parts of the movie were funny For example Gargamoms cats facial expressions
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_30,Im going to spoil skins right now I totally knew Maddie and Nick were going to be related I fucking knew it like I Knew it
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_3,I mean we did a little bit of it
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_14,That scene was like crazy
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_4,the voice acting Excellent
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_25,And I just loved it
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_25,And I think early on the twist is revealed
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_18,being released in a very interesting way
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_23,Definitely got some fun Kevin Smith moments in it for you to laugh with
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_19,We both like vlogged and shit
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_7,Hugh Jackman was always the best choice to play Wolverine I will admit that
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_8,and really well done
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_20,I thought it was really cool
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_4,but not a whole bunch and they should have
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_9,But I must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so I thought maybe it has a chance
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_13,Its a great one
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_6,It was enjoyable
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_25,Predator is a really wellpaced movie
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_30,And a lot of people have been saying that
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_17,first in the
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_18,And yeah I know we both have that and like an easy a
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_36,And uh theres not in my opinion there wasnt very much of a balance between sort of like the good and evil kind of thing
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_7,because it is a good movie
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_9,and I didnt really know what to expect from Newman in terms of his direction
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_3,I enjoyed it for what it was
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_11,I could I couldnt even believe it was Russell Brand
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_27,So I imagine if I was wearing 3D glasses and was seeing this in 3D I would enjoy it a lot more
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_30,Its not like the Green Lantern is the next Batman Begins or The Dark Knight
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_22,And I thought he made a good actor for the Deadpool character
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_11,Which I mean for a movie about GI Joe 90 minutes is enough
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_15,you know apparently according to people on the internet aka tumblr because everyone on tumblr is on crack they all think i look like her or like sound like her or act like her
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_27,felt the movie slowed down whereas it you in the middle of this where
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_20,Theyre huge
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_25,Theres a giant ass twist to this movie at the very end
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_26,And I feel like even though the fighting sequences were a little bit long in some places
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_2,but I actually found myself enjoying the movie and laughing
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_18,theres a roller coaster scene and if you get a little bit motion sick you might not want to see it in 3d because you feel like youre on this coaster
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_12,classic superhero kind of gettin on kind of thing
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_3,Its great if you remember those old films
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_27,You did a very good job
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_16,She looked phenomenal
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_22,um I just didnt think it was well developed enough and uh also I include in that Laurence Fishburnes character as well who
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_5,It was a pretty slow movie for the most part
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_16,I actually think Lee Trieber is a good actor
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_16,I dont know I guess we both have that male sounding voice
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_2,This movie is just too adorable
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_6,First off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is more thoughtprovoking than Inception
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_14,but otherwise I thought he was excellent As for 3D I
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_7,I wish that was Ryan Gosling
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_37,It seemed like everything was sort of overwhelmingly bad
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_8,The entire time I was constantly comparing it to Inception
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_6,Strange since one of my biggest gripes with the XMen series was and always is the casting
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_12,share those little cute money parts mixed in with the
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_18,The aliens are really cool
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_10,and I just had fun watching this movie
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_13,carried it
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_1,Anyhow it was really good
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_20,extremely wellmade its extremely
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_13,I really appreciate that loyalty
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_20,just different
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_19,makes it more visually appealing and
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_12,Its very very loyal to the book
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_17,She looked like a superhero
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_2,I loved the very first album in the Chipmunks movie because
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_20,you dont exactly know what is going on
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_10,overall I mean was it was okay Just average
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_62,very good time
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_32,Really good movie really good soundtrack
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_11,And I think why I would be scared is because I would feel scared and kind of sad if I lost my own mother
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_14,in everything she does She has so much grace to it and so much fluidity
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_42,can care about him
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_16,I mean the entire twothirds of it is Bella Swan Kristen Stewarts character moping around completely depressed
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_3,Its bold
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_21,Theyre really strong
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_46,Shes actually pretty good
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_5,This is a movie that youre going to go out and see
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_38,So at the end theres not really a whole lot of redeeming value that I think you come up with
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_40,he becomes more likable
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_8,the visual effects are pretty cool
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_5,But you know for this one I just didnt care
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_24,I mean this movie makes the Star Wars prequels
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_16,uh you know it had some interesting writing
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_19,and the guy on death row was an interesting character
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_2,Thats really the best way to describe this film Its big
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_35,and he does a really good job also
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_34,Um but its extremely dark
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_11,and I think that the movie did rely on you to kind of figure it out and kind of deal with those ideas by yourself
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_16,I thought she was another well drawn out character
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_13,its perfect for kids as well as just like teenagers as well who just want to see a lot of explosions and some crazy stuff and
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_47,Shes in everything now and again
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_9,It was funny though
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_13,which kinda just ruins the suspense right there because if theyve got some convenient guy in a fedora to just tell you oh yes we are the adjustment bureau and this is what we do you know just kinda just ruins the suspense
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_18,Thats really the route that youre going to go
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_14,Its a smart move since you know you have to be a real comic book fan to get what his name is supposed to be
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_7,Theyre so hilarious and similar to how a person would act
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_58,Not a huge flaw but its there and its noticeable
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_2,particularly the movies that I feel like should have gotten nominated but didnt and Never Let Me Go is actually one of those movies
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_10,But you know he did it
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_1,probably one of the ballsiest films of Sundance 2011
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_10,and the humor it was kind of necessary
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_19,and it seemed like they were going to go that route
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_11,I feel like if they wouldnt have inserted the humor into this movie it would have been just too serious and kind of boring in a sense
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_4,theres a certain deadpan nature to it
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_10,They werent fully explored
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_3,You gotta know what youre gonna go and see when you go walk into a movie called Cowboys Nailings
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_18,Of course its going to be making them look good which is fine
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_6,The cinematography in this movie is great
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_30,That was really boring
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_13,Its so well done for
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_49,But theyre not huge glaring flaws but
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_8,and there was like somewhat love somewhat there was a lot of action
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_33,Hes really really hardcore
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_13,and the action sequences in this movie are intense I
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_6,I saw no reason why they needed to bring back the villain from the first one
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_2,And my favorite characters in the movie would have to be Milo Milos mother and Gribble
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_2,Um some really good acting
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_38,it gives an entertaining performance as the kind of like the leader of the town
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_6,Weve got great jokes
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_24,Also I like how they just kind of upfront just showed them to us instead of hiding them like showing a little like an arm One scene or something No they just like straightup show it to us and I
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_13,Theres some really intense action scenes especially the scene when the aliens first invade
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_2,actually really fucking love this movie
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_11,Best part of the fucking ass movie was this one scene where Ryan Gosling is just standing there in a fucking suit eating pizza in slow ass motion
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_6,The biggest one is the CGI effects were just terrible
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_15,And the book isnt necessarily the most thrilling book ever
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_19,the angsty teen angsty moments were drawn out to the max as far as they could go and
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_8,and in my opinion he carried the movie fine
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_23,everyone can relate to
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_15,Interestingly it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than it was a thriller
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_28,And I think the Volturi that was the most exciting bit of the entire film
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_4,It reminded me of getting up on a Saturday morning and eating Froot Loops and watching cartoons
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_6,and it was it was thoughtful but there
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_1,Not to say that I really enjoy cowboys nearly
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_17,The action is really cool
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_8,He funnied up this movie big time totally
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_5,The storys pretty simple
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_9,so that doesnt surprise me
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_15,But its pretty selfexplanatory
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_9,You know nothing great
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_17,But when they figure out a new way to interpret this
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_19,But anyways they did act very well
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_30,He did a very good job of acting
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_19,Now other performances are borderline okay
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_26,Their moments on screen were scarce I mean they really werent in it a lot which is a shame because I thought the culture finding was really rather good
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_8,so Im gonna point out the stuff I did like There was some good action scenes in it
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_29,I really like a sicko guy but
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_24,and you know you shouldnt have been laughing
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_27,comedy romantic romcom
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_12,and theyre just like like zooming in on him and Im just like sitting here like man hes motherfucking drop
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_8,I love the scene where Eeyore and Pooh think that Owls getting sick
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_43,and also uh olivia wild shes pretty good shes beautiful
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_20,Overall overall it had far too many plot holes and
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_23,I thought that was very cool
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_1,But I can safely assure you that even if they didnt it would still be a hit
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_51,such as sometimes the aliens in the western setting do look a little goofy but
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_4,I also liked how the storyline of the movie worked together smoothly
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_56,like a movie called cowboys and aliens a lot of people would think would be kind of like crazy
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_8,And it depends what age you are and how you see the movie
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_9,Its a huge breakthrough for Kevin Smith
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_11,and children will like the movie
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_21,just not enough depth to be interesting
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_6,They were like Rachel Whitehurst needs some fucking fat material
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_24,and you dont exactly know whats going on
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_60,gonna give it an 8 out of 10
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_6,and I would recommend this movie for ages 3 and up
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_1,Now the title of the movie basically says it all
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_16,But it is absolutely horrifying
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_9,and the rest of it does look good as well
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_35,Ill warn you Its very very dark
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_13,Alright so enough of the nudity
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_14,Ida didnt care for it but
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_10,Its funny
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_7,But besides that it was all over pretty good
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_3,I dont know if fans of the comic would be as inclined to say the same because I dont know how much it differs from the comic or the radio program that people like so much
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_3,I think a lot of people are really split about this movie
Ses01,9c67fiY0wGQ_3,I think the movie really depicted the liveliness of New York City well since Im a New Yorker myself
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_11,action is really intense which surprised me
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_24,I always think is hilarious
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_54,I just thought it was kind of stupid
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_4,as you know as aliens was to alien
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_4,So anyway the movie was really fucking awesome
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_11,Its kind of weird
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_5,It makes big powerful statements
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_28,Im a little disappointed in myself for not realizing the twist before it actually twisted because
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_15,I say yes
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_24,Um he was awesome
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_6,and you want to see it in 3D because I
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_7,and most of you know hes a pretty funny guy and
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_20,But I think there was also some sort of like a tone within the actual powers of the Green Lantern himself in that he can basically think up of anything and you can project that into the real life
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_5,people were like eating popcorn and uh you see the first shot of them and people you hear like us this ripple effect of whispering oh my god is that a is it am i looking at this right what
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_20,the script it left all the key plots and emotion from the characters to be exposed through dialogue
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_21,I think it was Empire Magazines review of New Moon that said that Kristen relied heavily on the tactic of blinking a lot which she really does do a lot
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_10,I should give it a shot you know
Ses01,9T9Hf74oK10_1,This fucking movie
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_5,And Im going to really point out why I dont think he really pulled that off
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_12,I thought he was well developed
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_23,I think Rodriquez when he wrote the movie was going for a Marlon Brando Apocalypse Now type of character but I
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_31,I think he does a great job with what he does
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_23,The Green Hornet did something similar but
Ses01,6_0THN4chvY_14,I definitely recommend it
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_23,And I was thinking like if I can be motherfucking Emma Stone then Chris can be Ryan Gosling and it would just be great Didnt really happen this way
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_10,I am eight years old and I thought it was really kind of scary
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_63,and I definitely recommend you check it out in theaters
Ses01,9J25DZhivz8_12,I kept I was listening for it
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_14,Um what sucked what was bad was Malene Ackermans girl who plays the Silk Specter 2 uh junior
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_17,wasnt really the best the most thrilling read ever Ill say that So overall
Ses01,1DmNV9C1hbY_3,It had a real nostalgic feel to it
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_8,what was weird was the fact that in part of the movie hes wearing like a blue overall thong thing metal thong thing so I was like why not wear it the whole time you know why why you gotta go commando on us
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_18,Damon is a you know hes a pretty funny guy
Ses01,9qR7uwkblbs_8,The best part of the movie Im not gonna
Ses01,0h-zjBukYpk_17,and he almost looks exactly the same as his character in Defiance
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_2,They didnt really do a whole bunch of background info on why she has to fight and be prepared
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_1,I have to admit I was watching this I purposely put it on because I figured it would be something that would be stupid that I could fall asleep in the middle of and not miss too much
Ses01,8qrpnFRGt2A_15,And the last big thing was uh just the the it it I know its about GI Joe you know obviously its going to be about the army but it just felt like uh like uh military propaganda kind of like you know
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_28,Its very dark
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_61,It was really fun
Ses01,1iG0909rllw_22,but then the same goes for Robert Pattinson as Edward and Tingler Lautner as Jacob they do a lot of frowning Im a manly man and I frown
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_19,But just aside from that they really dropped the ball on the suspenseful parts
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_10,completely different from anything that weve ever seen him do before
Ses01,5W7Z1C_fDaE_4,strong
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_28,Its kind of interesting to see where theyre going to be going with it
Ses01,6Egk_28TtTM_5,And my favorite part in the movie was when Milo had to save Gribble
Ses01,_dI--eQ6qVU_18,and add something like an extra spark in there
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_10,but I would say that there was at least four good characters in there
Ses01,03bSnISJMiM_12,But it was really really awesome
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_6,I thought it was really funny
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_3,Some really sucky acting
Ses01,8d-gEyoeBzc_9,The characters were well developed not all of the characters
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_19,But one thing I like with the aliens is that A theyre not just weaklings that hide behind their technology
Ses01,2WGyTLYerpo_29,He kind of channels a man with no name Clint Eastwood
Ses01,2iD-tVS8NPw_1,Before I went in to see the Green Lantern I had been hearing all these like critics basically just trashing this movie left and right and I wasnt
Ses01,8OtFthrtaJM_22,I have to say my favorite character in the entire movie is the character Thompson
Ses01,7JsX8y1ysxY_7,UM THERE COULDVE BEEN LESS BLUE NUDITY ,-1.6
