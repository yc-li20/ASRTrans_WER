Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_20,He is average
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_12,And all those things are true but I dont think its trying to be that
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_9,You know I like Kate Hudsons
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_3,They could have made Zeus a little less sparkly it was very distracting
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_21,Maybe on par with the second one maybe a little behind that but it was a it was pretty good story
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_13,But what it lacks in those areas it most definitely makes up for just sheer visual spectacle
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_17,they had adult humor in them
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_10,This movie seemed um a little long
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_3,you should take your kids
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_1,What can I say Im just curious
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_14,So Im through with that guy
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_15,I just think they made her almost look too they tried to make her look too beautiful
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_9,Maybe better luck next time DreamWorks but for this one for me it just wasnt all I was hoping it would be
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_12,Its two girls trying too hard
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_18,and my friend next to me fell asleep and
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_11,I love my movies to be long
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_8,Johnny Depp doing the voice was fantastic
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_11,And dont get me wrong there were you know funny parts in the movie
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_3,I think the movies are phenomenal especially that first one
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_3,I dont think its like the worst movie Ive even seen just this year
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_6,All the funny parts werent
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_5,come off real and
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_24,He delivers a lot of intensity
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_8,Maybe the actings okay
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_15,So many moments in this movie that are just framed and lit so perfectly that so that you just go like kind of ooh Thats really really cool
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_4,First of all the movie was boring
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_18,And basically this makes no sense
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_16,But shes in trouble you know because she doesnt want to tell her best friend blah blah blah
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_1,But its actually worth talking about because
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_13,I dont care for basically any of it because
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_10,so I thought this movie would be funny
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_8,But its not bad I think the way most people have been saying its bad
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_23,Um and its really unpredictable
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_21,Im gonna have to say this one is probably gonna be wait until it comes out on HBO or
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_27,Disappointment definitely I do
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_2,a big transformers fan
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_3,Although what wasnt the same was the connection to each other with the first movie had and this one lacked
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_10,Its a bit of a mixed bag because there are some very bright moments
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_22,I just got really bored with it
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_1,I just want to let you know that 3D is really ridiculously expensive
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_7,I really dont care to see those
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_7,Everything you see in the trailer itself is pretty much all the humor youre gonna see in the movie
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_2,and I dont think thats a very good movie but
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_6,Uh but as far as humor goes not as much as I was expecting
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_11,one Im getting a little sick of the Michael Cera kind of lead character the sort of really awkward boy who is really awkward and stuff you know Im getting sick of that character and Im tired of him and
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_2,I like to tease its a mystery and great plot which could have been but then it all gets explained and disappears minutes later This was a clear remake of Predator from back in 1987 with the premise being almost identical
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_5,In this case it didnt take much convincing which is a little silly but
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_6,And Sucker Punch is a failure but like a really ambitious weird interesting idiosyncratic failure
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_10,One of the big things I was disappointed though was I felt that they could have done a lot more with 3D I thought
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_29,But I will say with this quality of 3D you could almost make a regular like a dramatic movie or an action movie or something that was really a good movie and you could make it 3D and it wouldnt at all
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_23,I just really do not like it
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_9,I guess for this kind of movie the plot is is threadbare the
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_22,Storm shadow is very cool
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_4,So its a little hesitant at first as you are with reboots
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_18,Blah blah blah
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_17,The screening I was at I kind of found myself wanting to lay my head back and take a nap
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_11,They really needed to somehow set them apart with armor
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_20,Sometimes 3D can mess up the color at least the old anaglyphic 3D I think Realty has sort of tinted lenses So its also not ideal for the image itself
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_5,Now Im not gonna lie there are a few parts that have great action sequences now even though it is an animated film it did have some great fight scenes
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_14,And thats exactly how I thought a giant scorpion would look with a piece of driftwood that had blue fire on it
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_12,I just really didnt have a good time
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_14,I know this is going to sound silly because its such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie but
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_15,Second there is one massive plot hole in this film and it is the size of a dragon thats as big as a mountain And when you see the film youll probably know what I mean
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_7,I mean the movie was I guess it was a waste of time
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_5,I mean the movie really wasnt funny at all
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_22,and really funny animation stuff It was great really funny
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_30,I uh Jesus I dont know it was its sad though because I expected so much more
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_3,The flying sequences are beautiful
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_2,But the movie itself was just a little dry
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_11,The light ends
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_7,But nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points I guess
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_32,and Im looking really forward to seeing that movie
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_20,Um yeah so anyways its really predictable
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_11,I think most people thats their knock on it is that its not you know conventionally satisfying as like you know a drama We dont get to know anything about these characters their plight isnt interesting their path to freedom is not compelling and its basically telescoped within the first ten minutes of the movie where were sort of told whats going to happen before it happens
Ses04,nbWiPyCm4g0_4,Firstly let me just say I saw quite a few guys at the cinema whod clearly been dragged there by their girlfriends and to those guys I say would you like me to sew your balls back on for you
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_11,The actors did a great job bringing the Smurfs to light such as George Lopez Neil Patrick Harris Katy Perry and so forth
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_8,hey she might like it but even then its not really funny at all
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_30,And I got to do my duty and let you guys know its a major suckfest
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_5,Its probably the best thing currently in theaters
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_21,The beginning started off great with a couple of good jokes
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_6,Of the acting nothing stands out as spectacular which is to be expected of a movie like this
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_10,I have two problems with it
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_11,Um I did enjoy it
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_6,I dont like cheesy jokes but cheats jokes are most times funny because theyre really bad
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_15,Um Medusa was way different from Percy Jackson and Land of the Lost which
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_31,because one of my cousins doesnt like the glasses
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_14,Three stars for Smurfs and stay Smurfy everyone
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_3,It was really boring to me
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_3,I personally think its a waste of money just
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_24,But hey if youre looking to spend some money go check it out maybe you will like it
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_8,in fact my sixyearold was scared most in the movie
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_11,wasnt there
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_24,Its really like if you went to go see the ballet and its about the spectacles
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_9,And I know that you cant hype a movie with unknown actors so even if someone is in it for a few minutes you should hype them
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_29,a fan of the original you know loved it
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_4,You just cant walk in expecting anything other than that
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_20,and my friends who were there had nothing good to say about it
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_14,He does some stereotypical things like talking about busting a cap while flying an airplane
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_6,But as the trailers came out I really liked what I was seeing
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_12,It was a great movie and I loved it
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_13,and voice acting was phenomenal
Ses04,nbWiPyCm4g0_1,And let me tell you its the past itself
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_9,My other complaint other than that theres like nothing light or funny in the story to break up the somber mood is the battle itself
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_21,It didnt have that much adult humor in it
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_13,and it just really wasnt good
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_6,the acting is bad the
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_2,Reacting is pretty bad
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_12,I dont really feel any emotional pull from him in this movie
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_14,I mean this movie has the most gorgeous visuals out of any movie since probably Avatar if not prettier
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_3,And its really glossed over with lots of stunning special effects and big explosions
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_4,In the first one they are a team and they work together and you see their personalities This movie just plops the group of different killers down together and lets them interact Poorly
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_5,And his acting wasnt really good in that movie but
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_10,I just felt like it seemed like it was a rushed movie
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_19,The color looked great
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_26,I do not want to see any more of this
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_6,It made it hysterical and it was just funny with all of his little oneliners that he had
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_8,Like I said before it had tacky one liners that were just hysterical
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_25,Theres a quote in this movie that sounded so dirty coming out
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_2,Id give it three stars
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_1,And he really seems to be channeling Michael Bay in this movie
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_7,I think the music they kind of put with the soundtrack really got me excited about seeing this movie
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_7,um after watching this movie i dont really think thats necessarily true uh i think the second movie and the third movie are very very similar um i think they tried to add a lot of heart
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_14,but the actual storyline was just terrible
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_27,about a waffle hole Am I the only one am I perverted enough to think that that sounds dirty because it totally does Waffle hole
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_13,Marlon Wayans kind of plays a watereddown version of himself from other movies
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_1,Nothing new was brought into this Predator series No surprises no big twist no finish
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_26,But it was great
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_7,Its a lot of fun to watch
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_22,And this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_17,The action was great you know not too much not too little just enough action
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_17,And so shes all sad walking in the rain blah blah blah
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_10,I mean her acting is like soso and I cant believe she even won an Oscar believe she won an Oscar for best supporting actress or best actress or something
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_9,to me someone needs to release the kraken on this movie and just totally destroy it because
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_20,I dont think it was as good as the first one obviously I think the first movie was just fantastic
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_3,I actually did not find the series to be a very fun popcorn kind of movie
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_19,And after the movie going out into the theater into the lobby I had no one I heard no one say anything good
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_2,And it is just like everybody saying it is bad
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_2,Dont get me wrong Kate Hudson is pretty fine looking but I just think its kind of stupid Not everyone says she has a fat ass
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_16,The two women in this movie are particularly good looking
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_25,But the story of Swan Lake isnt why people go see Swan Lake Its the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and the experience
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_20,The third one was more kid humor though
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_11,I mean that movie was a waste of time
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_19,And the two others were just bored
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_13,and it just was better maybe as the baby
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_24,I would love that
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_12,And I thought it was just going to be more than that So I was a little disappointed in that
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_17,Im not even kidding I went with a bunch of friends and a movie is supposed to be ten times better when youre with a bunch of friends
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_13,Im passionate about movies so thats fine
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_2,The first one was a lot better
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_31,Heard good things about the screenings on that
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_17,and so thats pretty entertaining
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_4,but very predictable
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_15,Its the same rise and fall
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_4,All in all its kind of a disappointment to any of us who grew up in the 80s and are used to the toys in the cartoon
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_13,I felt like Medusa really wasnt that scary
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_10,I give it about one and a half stars
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_2,The plot has the consistency of Swiss cheese and
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_26,were going to get burned out as a society
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_9,But if you were a child who grew up in that time period youre not going to enjoy this movie very much because
Ses04,nbWiPyCm4g0_2,It reached new heights of horrendous
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_7,Um it is bad
Ses04,nbWiPyCm4g0_7,Where the problem with that lies Im not entirely sure
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_11,But none of those things matter its a fun movie anyway
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_10,I did like the fourth one quite a bit
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_7,Plot is you know
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_12,Im getting angry about it Michael Cera doesnt play this character in this film but
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_11,that thumbs down if you dont understand
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_27,Once again were going to get burned out on 3D because its
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_6,but the first two were pretty excellent
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_1,The main draw for me for this movie was just the fact that its set in this ridiculous world with all these bright beautiful colors and ridiculous action sequences
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_11,Um the direction is a bit its wobbly
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_23,And I hope this takes over as the new system
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_11,and some really cool gunfights
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_5,I go for the more oldies type films I guess like the older Pixar films like Toy Story and all that stuff
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_28,It had me laughing out loud
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_12,Lawrence Fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screenwriters should have known about which gives a little bit more of a phony feel to this whole thing
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_3,didnt really do anything for me
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_4,But the real star that I felt of this movie was William Finchers character or William Fincher
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_8,And it just seems like too much too fast I mean theyre already telling each other they love each other and talking about getting wedding rings and spending the rest of their life together They live together I mean its just way too much too fast They tried to put a heart into it by you know him saying you know youre the only thing that matters in this world You know I dont care about myself You know cause she thinks hes doing crazy stuff sacrificing his life And then he does crazy stuff to save her And hes like I love you And you know just all the sappy blah blah blah stuff And its
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_9,and its really well written
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_20,um yeah so we were out for most of it we were talking about i was texting i just like i had absolutely the film had no draw to me
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_4,I dont think that this one got as much buzz and as much media attention and word of mouth you know spreading around and stuff
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_30,Um but yeah its its better than the Thermon absolutely
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_4,and the owls are really wonderful
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_10,You cant tell which are the good owls and which are the bad owls
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_23,Um and then towards the middle it was like what is going on
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_25,For my review Im going to say Im going to give it two thumbs down release the
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_10,I love the Shrek films
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_16,Uh I will I will actually say this right now It was a good waste of like 12
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_28,I did not want to give this movie a bad review
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_11,It seemed like there was no story development in it
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_10,um its one of those movies where most of the funny parts are in the commercial so youre like that movie has to be awesome and you go and you know youve seen the commercial so many times that that part isnt even funny anymore and then youre wondering where the hell is the rest of it it
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_14,Maybe it was because I was a kid back in the day but Medusa was a lot scarier then
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_13,which is a terrible picture but
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_5,I feel like it almost should have had a G rating
Ses04,POKffnXeBds_3,Yes she has a fat ass in terms of white girls but I mean her ass really isnt that fat
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_10,The uh character development is nil
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_12,popcorn movie
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_10,but just a little week overall for me then We were all looking forward to him and it was gone quickly
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_15,It was so bad I just did not enjoy it
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_7,whatever so now Im not saying this movie is bad because its not
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_17,um but uh they looked awesome
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_21,I mean you can go see it I personally didnt like it because
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_13,Just like when the girl tells the exact story of the first movie
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_14,uh but if youre an avid moviegoer like I am I totally recommend seeing this because its just a fun entertaining movie and i think that you will enjoy it
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_4,I mean I dont actually go and Im not being biased because I dont really go for the animated type films
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_12,It just wasnt it did not work for me
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_4,I would say I enjoyed Sucker Punch
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_7,So if thats the case then you should see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes predictable movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_4,I like the first two strikes quite a bit
Ses04,nbWiPyCm4g0_8,Let me see if I can rustle up some sympathy Yeah I got nothing
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_3,but I do think its a very interesting one
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_22,Um but yeah the fourth one it does have kid humor definitely
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_19,And this is what the fourth one kind of has
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_18,And actually the guy sitting next to me actually was taking a nap he kept dozing off
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_9,Uh which actually was really good
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_6,Um but this one was uh I dont know I mean the story was there but I dont know
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_9,The previews are much more 3D than it and so yeah it was very disappointing
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_1,and a guy who looks a lot like Tom Cruise
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_17,It doesnt make much sense I know
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_14,This one seemed long at some at some parts some
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_4,It was very hard to follow
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_24,But it does have some adult humor there was a
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_4,Just because I cant stand movies that are so predictable
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_16,its good to sit right in the middle of the theater with 3D
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_19,His performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_10,Because they arent playing to you theyre playing to a new audience of kids who dont know anything about these characters in the first place
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_15,had ideal seats
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_9,The script can be horrible
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_28,It is a gimmick ultimately
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_5,The first one made more sense
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_8,And thats why I was not excited about the fourth one
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_23,These bite sequences are pretty neat
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_12,Basically a lot of elements that I critique a movie on its really wobbly
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_25,I actually found myself checking the time because I was like when is this movie going to end
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_2,Unfortunately Im going to have to say this movie was terrible
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_9,too much too fast I mean we basically just get introduced to this character you know right away this is the first movie shes in and you know theyre already you know meant to be together forever and all that good slushy stuff
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_5,you know is it gonna be good
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_8,I think you will really love this movie if you are 8
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_21,And thats what traditional narrative movies do
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_1,which I was not excited to see
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_13,Now I dont really recommend this if youre going on a date with some girl
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_17,And the only explanation I can come up with makes this story kind of kind of creepy because
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_2,You know what you should see how to train your dragon
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_8,And then its definitely not a 3D movie
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_8,What disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in it for a short amount of time
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_6,and he said that this new one has a lot of heart similar to the first one
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_12,Anyway this is one you can skip
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_4,I can tell you that Tron Legacy is not a good movie
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_16,and then take that world and then set like a crap ton of really kinetic really welldone action sequences in it and you have Tron Legacy
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_11,All I can say is hes a pretty average guy
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_15,It doesnt give any insight or help It just makes them seem like she saw the first movie
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_4,And if you dont have kids you may want to consider seeing it anyway
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_6,Just different people playing the roles
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_6,And they do have very nice personalities
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_29,And I dont think that many of the people were laughing about it
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_2,Um this movie is dumb
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_16,Um theres no explanation for this thing
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_7,You know a movies terrible when a person trying to review it doesnt even know what to say But I dont know this movie was
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_10,and that was a big movie
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_3,And I have to admit I like Shrek I do
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_7,and I hate to say that
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_1,I was a little bit disappointed in the film
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_26,cracking on this movie dont go see it go see something else how to train a dragon and thats all Im going to say about that so
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_4,Even the kids in the audience itself just kind of chuckled a little bit gave a few laughs
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_23,and the characters theyre all just placeholders
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_7,they pretend like its gonna be this big scene it maybe lasts about a minute and I was like is that it
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_3,Didnt have a whole lot of humor going on with it At least none that really made you want to laugh out loud
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_13,He might as well
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_7,The third one was a piece of crap
Ses04,nbWiPyCm4g0_9,I dont know if Charlottes storyline made me never want to have kids or never want to have rich friends
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_17,So its like put some people in it that youre going to enjoy spending time with
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_27,I tell you I couldnt get out of that movie theater fast enough
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_28,Um in general um the little kids seem to like it that were in there
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_16,and youre just kind of like okay lets get to it We know whats gonna happen Lets go ahead and do it
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_3,Um I was really looking forward to it
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_23,Definitely its a kids movie
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_24,I just get so tired of unpredictable movies
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_8,The performances are meh
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_10,Um it really is not trying to be a dramatic film or an action film
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_3,only because it was very predictable very predictable
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_11,Although what he did do was interesting but didnt make sense
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_1,I went into this movie very very excited
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_24,I dont understand like
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_25,be cool to see
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_20,and then you know put in some action or some romance and sex or whatever to keep people sort of engaged
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_8,You know along with the Zohan I would probably say go see this movie at an early showing I dont spend a lot of money for the night viewing
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_14,But this 3D definitely looks a lot better I think than real D
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_5,that I guess the only other problem I had with it was that the jokes were really cheesy
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_15,parts just kind of dragged on and you kind of you know I sit in the movie theater and this is a big action movie one of the biggest movies of the summer and you kind of just wanted to you know rest your head while you watched because some of the sequences and some of the scenes are just kind of long
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_1,but it was a good movie
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_29,the adults were the adults that were actually attempting to watch it and people who are my age as well were like what did I just see
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_12,So it is not a buy
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_6,In the Kraken you know in the preview its like so much hype
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_7,But the story is very dark
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_5,I was more entertained by it than Battle LA which was just a slog and boring and I just found it totally uninteresting
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_18,at home that adults could appreciate
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_1,could have been better
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_18,some funny dialogue make
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_15,But it really has more in common with a musical or an opera or even a ballet than a regular narrative film
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_14,Its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_15,And hes pretty average too
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_1,which is a reboot I guess would be the best term for the I believe it was 1981 movie Clash of the Titans
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_8,its beautifully done
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_19,them compelling and their relationships compelling and then have a story thats like at five minutes this happens in ten minutes this happens that like moves forward it has momentum
Ses04,PZ-lDQFboO8_12,But as far as Kung Fu Panda goes I was hoping for a lot more It just wasnt there for me I dont know
Ses04,Oz06ZWiO20M_16,Mainstream narrative film is about character development and plot and then spectacle like in third place
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_16,but I just as a whole really did not like this movie
Ses04,lXPQBPVc5Cw_2,But Im not going to lie to you it wasnt good
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_21,and its so shortlived he barely needs to even be there
Ses04,MLal-t_vJPM_6,it is its a great story
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_21,But this looked amazing Really good
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_19,a pretty good script
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_13,but the CGI was great and
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_7,Tron Legacy is a movie where on most counts that I judge movies it kind of fails
Ses04,nzpVDcQ0ywM_18,This is a really big movie for their careers because I havent really seen them in a lot of big movies
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_19,Ive been saying that a lot in this video Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Ses04,nbWiPyCm4g0_5,Also if youre a straight man and you voluntarily willingly go and see this film Im going to need you to light a candle say a prayer and ask yourself some questions
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_1,Im going to give this a grade B
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_22,or get it at Redbox for a buck
Ses04,Njd1F0vZSm4_2,The CGI work the 3D is spectacular
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_18,Uh the story was alright
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_9,It was good
Ses04,OtBXNcAL_lE_8,But you know what I took a chance
Ses04,nbWiPyCm4g0_6,This is really just a continuation of the first film
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_5,In interviews Shia LaBeouf said that the second movie lacked heart
Ses04,Qr1Ca94K55A_1,This movie is just ridiculous and I I thought it was excellent
Ses04,OQvJTdtJ2H4_16,the best part about the movie I got a free pair of glasses
Ses04,nbWiPyCm4g0_3,This movie isnt just bad its diabolical
Ses04,ob23OKe5a9Q_9,The part that I have with the movie theater is that there were kids crying the whole time and it got on my nerves did that ever get on your nerves does baby crying get on your nerves ever Does it Should it It does I wouldnt recommend going to this movie because theres a bunch of kids unless you go to a really late showing because I dont think kids are going to be out that late but thats the only other problem I have with the other
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_5,Um theyve become quite a bit overrated
Ses04,phBUpBr1hSo_12,I dont think a movie can ever be too long you know I like you know The Dark Knight was you know two hours and 45 minutes you know Im Titanic you know all those movies Avatar all those movies that are you know three hours you know thats fine by me I like long movies
Ses04,QN9ZIUWUXsY_5,but I was still ridiculously entertained by it
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_14,Maybe bringing in the baby ogres really brought it down
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_12,It reminded me of the first one It had the same kind of vibe as the first one
Ses04,k5Y_838nuGo_16,The first two were kid movies
Ses04,Nzq88NnDkEk_8,And being a fan of the original I was looking forward to seeing it
Ses04,LSi-o-IrDMs_22,It makes it worth going to see this movie if youve got the Dolby 3D somewhere in your in your town
Ses04,pLTX3ipuDJI_16,IN FINALE I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR A RENTAL NON IN THEATER BECAUSE ITS A LOW GRADE SEQUAL TO THE 87TH VERSION AND ONLY IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES,-1.6
