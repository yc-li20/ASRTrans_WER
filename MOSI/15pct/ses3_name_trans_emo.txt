Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_6,In fact this movie isnt even on the same level as District 9 nor is it for Black Hawk Down which people are comparing it to
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_13,But in this movie he wasnt good at all
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_3,It looked like it had a good core
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_2,I did not think I was going to like it
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_10,The movies too long
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_27,I hated it
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_26,Well I can tell you right now I dont remember the names of any characters None of them were memorable and
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_7,I felt like she was winning there
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_26,I really like David Fincher
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_7,And I gotta say I wasnt blown away by it
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_6,she gets there is forced to not only be trapped in a location that she obviously doesnt want to be in
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_16,I dont usually like
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_14,just give me a nice interesting chunk
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_10,dancers wonderful it
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_9,great steamy bedroom scenes
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_5,It kind of follows the path of My Best Friends Wedding the 1997 Joey Roberts movie except it takes 30 minutes longer to deviate from the script of My Best Friends Wedding
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_10,I think this one did beat Scream 2
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_5,let them know before the let
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_6,but what really threw me off was the dialogue very cheesy dialogue
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_1,Um first things first Christina Aguileras pipes I swear they update that Um
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_9,Thats what GI Joe was it was just like the acting is terrible
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_41,Dont see this movie
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_6,They have a lot of adult situations in it
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_18,You ladies go together to see it together
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_4,It just goes to show that you really cant trust anyone in this situation
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_8,I think its predictable up and to a point
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_9,Um I thought the storyline was really cute
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_24,I kind of would have read that then like hmm I mean Schwarzenegger never said anything really that badass in his movies
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_14,You know it matches the whole theme of the movie You know cabaret and you know the works
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_20,The trailer looked like it could be a little good
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_12,give some more details so I cant wait to get my hands on it now
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_13,We did not need the entire spance birthed to death
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_4,I wasnt expecting to because
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_12,the problem with a lot of comic book shows or movies
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_21,But when I saw it it was just totally boring
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_17,Why is this person wearing tights
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_32,I liked it
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_9,It kind of looks like a video game in a certain way
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_15,And they needed a character establishment right away
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_30,So it was an interesting movie
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_39,which is cool
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_5,It was so good
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_2,Nichols Cage should not do these kind of movies
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_14,but they knew it was just a movie about a doll so they didnt take it seriously
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_29,Its not my favorite film ever
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_6,Not a bad idea for a sequel
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_14,Unless your kids are dying to see it Id wait for the DVD
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_1,and growth in the characters Its usually a path of discovery
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_2,But overall go see it
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_15,and overall probably i give it about 35 stars you know popcorn movie and you know because
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_24,Theres not like a really good twist
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_5,A fun lightweight date movie
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_34,which were disastrous so enjoy
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_10,The plot is ridiculous but no one took it seriously
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_15,Is this good
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_20,how much I really did enjoy it so I would
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_12,Another thing is we dont need his entire life
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_4,So I think Thor is really going to do well
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_2,last minute title that they threw on at the theaters
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_24,but its like someone made you a kickass sandwich but they put mayonnaise on it and you dont like mayonnaise and its not like tomato or lettuce where you can pick it off No its got its mayonnaise and its all over everything And now youre stuck with this kickass sandwich that would be kickass if it didnt have mayonnaise on it but it has mayonnaise on it Or you go make another sandwich Go make another sandwich Go make another sandwich
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_5,that happened in Shrek 1 2 and 3 are wiped away
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_32,Every single scene was CGI
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_7,Um usually Im not really a big huge scifi alien kinda fan but
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_9,the aliens are really awesome they
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_10,Hoover wrote this isnt the best writer definitely but overall
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_9,so they could kind of get a little bit of Chris Hemsworths star power into that
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_16,I do think its worth seeing
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_13,I cant wait until the next one comes out too
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_6,You never know whats going to happen
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_4,someone watch the third act of district 9 a bunch of times like lets make this into an entire movie itll be awesome and thats pretty much what they did here but
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_10,and also the cute winks to pop culture
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_20,So easy on the eye
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_18,There is no good dialogue nothing
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_17,It made no sense
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_40,DONE
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_3,Theres some great bedroom scenes
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_9,I hate Scream 3D but
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_21,recommend this movie
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_8,I didnt think it was great or epic or just fantastic
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_28,Its my favourite film ever
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_7,Also the livestream too I think
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_15,Im just kind of like no this is going too far
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_11,that you respect that Joe Wright tried to do something completely different here
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_16,But its not great
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_20,I went into the movie thinking theres no way
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_12,throughout the whole movie I was you know thinking this isnt as bad as Ive heard and it wasnt
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_8,it was really really good
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_3,Priscilla from The Readables gave it such a good review
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_22,Like I said before its a very interesting idea
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_11,Um it has it has a very predictable story but
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_28,But and its a good story
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_17,It was like the acting was terrible The action made up for it
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_21,Its got two of my favorite actresses in it Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_3,yells and screams to the whole movie and
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_7,Because when you see her face moves it feels like you know you feel worried for her
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_5,pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_30,My neighbor probably thinks Im crazy yelling about movies to a camera Oh well
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_26,They didnt belabor Thor on Earth
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_4,So I saw some other reviews and I was like okay I was surprised because
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_13,He added a great dimension to the movie as well
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_11,sexy but not slutty you know
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_9,I dont think the humor redeemed the movie for being so bad in the dialogue department
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_14,It was phenomenal
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_25,This movies just not quite good enough
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_1,I mean it starts out really slow
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_12,It seemed like the writers and creators took the easy way out
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_29,You got the whole shield involvement which is cool to then see that A lot of cool little references At one point they referenced a doctor with gamma radiation
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_16,Definitely a little bit above average
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_12,boy Hes very good at Hellboy
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_22,And I think the directors of Thor and the script writers did that right away
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_32,And Ill tell you all about like the cool premiere and stuff
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_16,Um and I cant wait for the next one to come out
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_5,I think its going to catapult Chris Hemsworth to being a bigger star
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_29,You know they just tried so hard with the CGI that they threw so much CGI at you
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_3,and she showcases it really really well in this movie
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_19,they convinced me like this chick could probably take that dude down which is pretty hard because
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_3,I really did not want to go see it
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_6,Theres some funny moments but
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_12,I wasnt expecting that much
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_5,The first problem is that its all told in flashback from a point just before Katrina hits New Orleans
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_4,and he puts them in very strange and unusual characters
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_5,But she still looks like shes 48
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_11,They have really cool technology thats really interesting to watch like make them blow up shit and you know and
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_17,But the dialogue is terrible
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_12,Im sure you all remember the Stav movies that were based on the Scream movies or the experiences of Sydney inuniverse so that people could comment on the killers reacting the movies or following up the movies Well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_14,And it turns out that James Frey who I really like
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_19,Everything in this movie is cleverly written
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_3,Hes always in these kind of movies all these sorcerer witch voodoo kind of movies
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_11,This credit sequence I think is the best credit sequence since Watchmen
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_11,So I will give it points for not being exactly like My Best Friends Wedding even though the trailer sets it up that way
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_25,but alright And moving on theres no character development in this movie None
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_5,Um whats really neat about this movie is the Chemical Brothers did the soundtrack so its pulsepounding the entire way through
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_2,But unfortunately its just an ugly loud violent uninvolving and sadistic exercise that
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_17,I was really excited
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_6,That one takes him seriously
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_27,And they were all just really bland and forgettable
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_13,If it was Anne Hathaway who did the singing she did a great job
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_18,and we really wanted to get out of the house Last night yesterday was
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_7,I didnt really see a comparison to Black Hawk Down till like the very very end
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_16,is very boring
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_4,And if you can tolerate her the rest of the movie isnt any better
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_17,but he has some of the funnier scenes in this movie
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_6,I thoroughly enjoyed it
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_15,enough that it actually is a good reason why theyre attacking
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_11,overall enjoyed it
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_11,heard that in the book it describes the planet of Lorien a lot better
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_12,Jennifer Goodwin is fun to watch
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_24,But they also do a great job of building the backstory of Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman and her crew and how they relate to Thor
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_16,all the awesome movies that we had in the year like Inception and Black Swan and you know the social network
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_27,Its not like you need to learn from the earthlings
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_2,The premiere itself was really cool
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_5,I was like you know theyre both Hasbro toys theyre both movies that are made for children but
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_8,very boring
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_13,I should make that movie I want to see it but
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_31,Like it was like spewing CGI last half hour of the movie
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_8,theres some funny lines
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_8,But nevertheless another really cool thing about this movie
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_18,This looks like it just has a polyurethane coating on it
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_17,Certainly again more of a date movie than seeing it alone unless you
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_7,When he was on screen I wanted to punch him in the face
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_16,And it keeps your interest in the action scenes at least during this movie
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_5,But it didnt turn out quite nearly as awesome as that movie did
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_2,Like the dude that made the technology is I cant ruin the one person
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_13,kind of playing with the idea of whats real whats not that the Matrix films did
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_10,Im so curious to see how the storyline got to that point
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_1,It certainly had the potential to be a film that was both thoughtprovoking and actionpacked
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_7,And the end part is really really funny because
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_31,And I can imagine getting this on DVD and watching it at Christmas time because it makes you feel so like Its not about commercialization Its about you know families being together
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_13,in your face
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_13,I dont think shes leading material
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_6,It surpassed my expectations
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_21,You have to establish that fairly quickly
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_14,And like I said Kate Hudson couldnt be more annoying here
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_16,and something that I cant find anything else to compare it to
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_15,Very boring as well
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_4,And you know it makes you wanna know who else you know in the industry nowadays has the voice like that And you know its not
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_16,This also falls into the trend that is very popular these days You do a whole lot of CGI
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_12,so theyre just sitting there like
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_11,The animation was amazing
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_12,I thought Woody Harrelson was funny
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_33,but I just wanted to put this up soon
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_1,This movie was horrible
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_19,The style of the film like the er the freeze frames the slow motion the er the jump cuts and all that stuff feels very kind of erm Tarantinoesque
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_17,I dont think its as bad as you probably read on reviews
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_13,It really is good I mean
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_36,How bad the acting and action was it was just so dull
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_23,but he totally sells it
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_15,Other than that I think it was an okay movie
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_16,Im not really in a big hurry at my age to go see animated movies
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_7,But mostly its just Kate Hudson being very annoying
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_2,Now the real star of Something Borrowed is Jennifer Goodwin
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_11,They did very well to establish the character of Thor
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_12,Eric Bana decides to train to be this most paranoid assassin chick in the world because
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_17,This one you know probably in the middle so 35 stars
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_19,Makes it look too too good
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_14,Although actually the best comparison for this film actually would be something like Pans Labyrinth
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_2,Its a weird thing
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_21,So good on you America for doing that
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_8,I dont know
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_6,I didnt need any of that crap
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_14,I mean it kind of feels like a Sundance Film Festival type of movie
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_2,But for any of you who are I expect a thumbs up
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_4,But just too many problems with it
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_11,But it was in good taste
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_3,I got very little joy out of
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_36,It wasnt it wasnt the usual
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_11,you just need to cut that out
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_15,No one has had the battle
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_1,It was a really cute movie
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_1,Whatever The names too long
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_25,Its a good action movie its like
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_1,So you better appreciate this review
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_23,And this is the worst by far
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_12,so what Its still a really great movie to take your whole family to
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_10,Its basically a slow motion showcase of different events
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_19,I had no idea why I saw this movie
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_7,But the thing about GI Joe compared to Transformers is Transformers 2 didnt know what it wanted to do like
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_10,I was surprised the amount of skin they showed
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_39,season of The Witch was horrible acting
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_6,It contains really well done and faithful homages to the zombie horror subgenre
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_16,on what you get in sitcoms And in terms of comic books and comic book movies it takes a while to develop that
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_7,Theres some scenes where I think some of the women are going to feel more of the emotion of it
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_14,Its really nonstop from beginning to end
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_35,I was sitting there in the theater laughing how bad the movie was at some point
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_27,but Im just going to have to say its
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_11,It was it was an okay movie basically
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_3,It was a cool movie
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_9,He was very annoying
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_18,It is good though like
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_12,And they always pull out something new
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_10,great movie overall
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_13,but its not always quite explained you know like everything about the unspe
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_38,the music kind of drove a lot of the action
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_4,The thing about this movie is I want to compare it to Transformers 2 and I actually did
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_18,So yeah go see it
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_34,Oh it wasnt bad
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_11,and I was sitting with Peter sleeping
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_8,I think its highly underrated
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_1,I always like to read the book first
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_3,DreamWorks is confusing me
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_7,Um this is a great family movie to take your whole family to this movie
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_35,But it was it was interesting
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_14,and the dialogue threw me off other
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_5,and they both liked it
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_7,Now that also takes a really creepy element when you consider the fact that Emily Browning in this movie looks like shes underage
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_8,There were a couple funny parts but
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_10,The first time she goes in it looks like a Japanese temple
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_25,no sense
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_3,and I actually liked the film a lot and I
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_7,I dont need it all told in flashback
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_4,The acting was alright
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_22,It wasnt really made well
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_24,but Im really really really glad that I saw it
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_7,Theres all these colorful characters
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_13,And the movie was pretty short
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_8,Now it isnt a great fantastic tell everybody about it kind of movie
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_15,I give Shrek Forever After directed by Mike Mitchell a grade of B
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_38,do not see this movie
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_23,It doesnt have a deepseated plot
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_14,But it actually basically makes the characters cognizant not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_15,and scale it down to like two hours
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_8,but its really well done
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_9,And overall the movie is quite entertaining
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_9,because you really want to see it for yourself
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_24,It was very very very boring
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_18,I didnt really care about it all
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_17,But its a very kind of stylistic edge on it
Ses03,jUzDDGyPkXU_22,There are moments where he says something and youre like that just sounded dumb as hell
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_28,With the last half hour of the movie it felt like they were having a CGI orgasm
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_13,If it werent for the great characters of Shrek and his supporting cast who are still voiced by the original stars Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas the film would be a real bust
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_11,In their place is a runofthemill animated actionadventure plot with a few chuckles thrown in
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_19,I can see it
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_4,you guys that youre gonna get to enjoy
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_12,Ive always dropped it gorgeous by the way
Ses03,fvVhgmXxadc_11,And later times she goes to like a World War II battlefield Castle just kind of pulled out of Lord of the Rings
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_1,and I was pretty open to it being good
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_1,Wilson who have named themselves after the places to which theyre travelling which I think is a really nice touch is
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_5,and I was pleasantly surprised about this movie
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_3,He takes great actors or actresses in this case like Thorsy Ronan and Cate Blanchett in the movie
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_10,And again it does really tug at the heartstrings with the little baby animals in the beginning
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_8,Hes been such a grumpy character and then hes really scared and at the end hes so changed and its really funny
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_18,Why are they carrying a hammer
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_10,But I think its one of those movies thats so unique
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_33,The soundtrack was interesting
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_21,Guys Pinkys my new favorite
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_14,I had no idea that Anne Hathaway could really sing
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_6,but I thought it actually worked really well
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_10,He annoyed me with what he was talking about and
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_25,So I think that was really good
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_11,Like even the actors were just like you know its a movie about a fucking toy
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_13,Anyways skipping past that shes got this like kickaattitude
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_25,And I would recommend it to other people Its true
Ses03,Dg_0XKD0Mf4_5,I thought they casted kind of well
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_22,I doubt that theyre going to do this for all of the screenings because it was the premiere
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_3,I think that will do very well
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_3,The clash of personalities is really charismatic and dynamic and it
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_31,It was original
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_9,it doesnt it just its too much crap in here
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_15,He wrote a good book
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_8,Its great for all ages
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_21,And so they kind of explain it a little bit but not really
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_19,He was unbelievable
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_23,Ive chosen to go and see that
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_14,But the audience that was watching it they needed to pay off right away
Ses03,IumbAb8q2dM_18,Um as for Alex Pettifer I am a new Alex Pettifer
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_18,He seems to be the only realistic character here
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_2,At first when I saw the previews I thought it was gonna be stupid to be perfectly honest
Ses03,etzxEpPuc6I_8,at some parts you had people getting killed and then the next part you had fart jokes and some stupid frat humor and all that other crap
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_7,And while it also maintains its kind of detached satire of the genre
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_3,Theyre back to you having two killers thankfully
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_17,That was one of my other concerns
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_7,But also not very original Shrek
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_8,misses out on the magic that made the first film a real joy to view
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_10,we second guess ourselves
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_22,At the end of the movie the friends I was with one of them goes was there a plot to this movie
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_29,And visually its kind of cool how they show her confusion because she grows up in the woods
Ses03,iiK8YX8oH1E_1,Its one of those romantic comedies that we all dread
Ses03,f9O3YtZ2VfI_29,But its a pass
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_4,and its getting really tiring
Ses03,GWuJjcEuzt8_18,And if you have money to spend go ahead
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_15,But overall I thought it was a fun picture
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_10,and its all kind of its hard to explain
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_17,But there really hasnt been much that has come out this year so far that Ive been dying to go see
Ses03,Iu2PFX3z_1s_9,I gave it a B
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_26,Even though I was like oh Im gonna hate it
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_4,They solved this dilemma by removing the past with an its a wonderful life twist courtesy of new baddie Rumpelstiltskin Everything that happened in Sh
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_37,boring
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_20,But yeah generally the accents were really really good
Ses03,Jkswaaud0hk_1,Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake I thought they made a great duo Mila Kunis she
Ses03,d6hH302o4v8_26,action scenes were very dumb
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_19,I was thoroughly surprised
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_6,And all the people walking into the theater and beyond the trailer really liked it so
Ses03,G-xst2euQUc_15,Anyway I would recommend it if youre like me and you dont normally go to see animated movies
Ses03,dq3Nf_lMPnE_9,Gone are the wickedly satirical sendups of the world of fairy tales
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_19,Why what is their mission
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_13,And you saw us with the NBC recent flap of the cake which was a show I loved
Ses03,f_pcplsH_V0_11,I really like the first hour that much though
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_5,I thought how the hell is Dickens and Disney gonna work together Like theyre so
Ses03,d3_k5Xpfmik_18,Its almost like imagine if Tarantino directed a zombie movie
Ses03,I5y0__X72p0_27,Theres some really strange characters in this movie that
Ses03,G6GlGvlkxAQ_8,Hes winning now
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_18,that as an English person I get really annoyed when American shows and films have an English character
Ses03,HEsqda8_d0Q_15,You kind of forget about the fact that its 3D the voices
