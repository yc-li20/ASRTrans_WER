Sad,Ses02M_impro06_F010.wav,Yes you are
Sad,Ses02F_script01_3_M027.wav,For instance one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks I put them in my pocket It's only a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had
Sad,Ses02F_impro02_F008.wav,I know but she needs to be safe more She needs to be around kids her own age She needs to be able to play on the street and
Ang,Ses02M_script01_1_F027.wav,I just don't see why it has to be Annie
Hap,Ses02M_script02_1_M028.wav,Okay but it's fish that do something none of you have a fish do like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings Throwing themselves off the cliffs

Hap,Ses02M_impro03_F005.wav,And it's like they've been definitive
Sad,Ses02F_impro02_F004.wav,Well we can do the best we can and with wireless internet these days I think we could probably talk every once in a while

Neu,Ses02M_impro04_F015.wav,But like just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should stop
Hap,Ses02F_impro07_F021.wav,I've thought about it but they have so many different things that I think I might try some things out for
Neu,Ses02M_impro08_M020.wav,I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes information gets out
Neu,Ses02F_impro05_M003.wav,you know I mean there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes you know that that kind of things happen
Hap,Ses02M_script03_1_M014.wav,Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light
Ang,Ses02M_script01_1_M021.wav,See it isn't just my business
